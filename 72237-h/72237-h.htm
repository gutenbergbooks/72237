<p class='c016'>The Bad Boy Wants to Be an Orphan—The
Bad Boy Goes to an Orphan Asylum—The
Government Gives the Bad Boy’s
Pa an Appointment to Travel Over the
World and Get Information About Airships,
Dirigible Balloons and Everything
to Help Our Government Know
What Other Governments Are Doing in
Case of War.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have always wanted to be an orphan and
I guess now I have got my wish.</p>

<p class='c018'>I have watched orphans a whole lot and
they have seemed to me to have the easiest
job outside of politics.</p>

<p class='c018'>To see a good mess of orphans at an
Orphan Asylum, with no parents to butt in
and interfere with your enjoyment has
seemed to me to be an ideal existence.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>When a boy has a father that he has to
watch constantly to keep him from going
wrong he has no time to have any fun, but
to belong to a syndicate of orphans, with
an easy old maid matron to look after the
whole bunch, an individual orphan who has
ginger in him can have the time of his young
life. At least that is the way it has always
seemed to me.</p>

<p class='c018'>They set on the food at an orphanage, and
if you have a pretty good reach, you can
get enough corralled around your plate to
keep the wolf from the door, and when it
comes to clothes, you don’t have to go to a
tailor, or a hand me down store, and take
something you don’t want because it is
cheap, but you take any clothes that are
sent in by charitable people, which have
been worn enough so there is no style about
them, and no newness to wear off by rolling
in the grass, and you put them on and let it
go at that, if they do smell of moth balls.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa has skipped and I am left alone and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>shall enter as a freshman in an Orphan
Asylum, and later go out into the world and
travel on my shape.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa took me to Washington and for a week
he was visiting the different Departments,
and nights he would talk in his sleep about
air ships and balloons, and forts and battleships,
and about going abroad, until I
thought he was getting nutty.</p>

<p class='c018'>One day he called me up to our room in
the hotel and after locking the door, and
plugging up the keyhole with chewed paper
he said: “Now, Hennery, I want you to
listen right out loud. The government has
given me an appointment to travel over the
world and get information about air ships,
divagable balloons, and everything that will
help our government to know what other
governments are doing in inventing things
to be used in case of war. I am to be the
Billy Pinkerton of the War Department
and shall have to spy in other governments,
and I am to be the traveling diplomat of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>the government, and jolly all nations, and
find out how things are running everywhere.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You will have to stay home this time because
you would be a dead give away, so I
will send you to a nice orphan home where
you will be taught to work, and where
guards will keep you on the inside of the
fence, and put you to bed in a straight jacket
if you play any of your jokes, see?” and Pa
gave me a ticket to an orphans’ home, and
a letter of introduction to the matron and
the next day I was an inmate, with all the
degrees coming to me. What do you think
of that, and Pa on the ocean, with a government
commission in his pocket?</p>

<p class='c018'>Gee, but my ideas of an orphans’ home
got a shock when I arrived at the station
where the orphans’ home was located. I
thought there would be a carriage at the
train to meet me, and a nice lady dressed
in white with a cap on her head, to take me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>in her arms and hug me, and say, “Poor little
boy, I will be a sister to you,” but there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>was no reception committee, and I had to
walk a mile with my telescope valise, and
when I found the place and went in the
door, to present my letter to the matron, a
man with a scar on his face, and one eye
gone, met me and looked over my papers,
and went, one eye on me, and called an assistant
private and told him to take me and
give me the first or entered apprentice degree.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Gee, My Ideas of an Orphan Home Got a Shock.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The private took me by the wrist and gave
me a jerk and landed me in the laundry, and
told me to strip off, and when I had removed
my clothes and folded them and laid
them on a table, he took the clothes away
from me, and then told me to climb into a
laundry tub, and he turned cold water on
me and gave me a bar of yellow laundry
soap, and after I had lathered myself he took
a scrubbing brush, such as floors are
scrubbed with, and proceeded in one full
swoop to peel the hide off of me with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>rough crash towel till you could see my
veins and arteries, and inside works as well
as though you had used X-rays, and when I
was ready to die and wanted to, I yelled
murder, and he put his hand over my mouth
so hard that he loosened my front teeth, and
I guess I died right there or fainted, for when
I came to, and thought the resurrection
morning, that they used to tell me about in
the Sunday School, had come. I found myself
dressed in a sort of combination shirt
and drawers, like a bunny nightie, made of
old saddle blankets, and he told me that was
the uniform of the orphanage and that I
could go out and play for fifteen minutes,
after which the bell would ring and I could
go from play to work. Gosh, but I was glad
to get out doors, but when I began to
breathe the fresh air, and scratch myself
where the saddle blanket clothes pricked
me, about fifty boys, who were evidently
sophomores in the orphanage, came along,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>and made a rush for me, to haze me as a
freshman.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, they didn’t do a thing to me. They
tied a rope around one ankle, and threw the
rope over a limb, and pulled me off the
ground, and danced a war dance around me
and run thistles up my trouser’s legs, and
spanked me with a board with slivers in it,
and let me down and walked over me in a
procession, singing “There’ll be a hot time
in the old town to-night.” I laughed all
the time, because that is the way freshmen
do in college when they are being murdered,
and I thought my new associates
would like me better if I died game. Just
before I died game the bell rang, and the
one eyed pirate and his chief of staff came
out and said we would go to work, and the
boys were divided into squads and put to
work, some husking corn, others sweeping
up dead leaves, others milking cows, and doing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>everything necessary around a farm.</p>

<p class='c018'>Before I was set to work I had a few
minutes of silent reflection, and I thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>of my changed condition from my porcelain
lined bath tub with warm water and soft
towels, to that bath in the laundry, and the
skinning process of preparing a boy for a
better life.</p>

<div id='il_2'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/airship_pic2.png'><img src='images/airship_pic2.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Way Freshmen Do in College When They’re Being Murdered.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Then what do you suppose they set me to
work at? Skinning bull heads and taking
out the insides. It seems the boys catch
bull heads in a pond, and the bull heads are
used for human food, and the freshest boys
were to dress them. Well, I wasn’t going
to kick on anything they gave me for a stunt,
so I put on an apron, and for four hours I
skinned and cut open bull heads in a crude
sort of way, until I was so sick I couldn’t
protect myself from the assaults of the live
bull heads, and the cook said I done the job
so well that she would ask to have me skin
all the bull heads after that. I said I would
rather milk cows so the pirate gave me a
milk pail and told me to go and milk the
freckled cow, and I went up to the cow as I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>had seen farmers do, and sat down on a
wooden camp stool and put the pail under
the cow, and began to squeeze the Summer
Sausages she wore under her stomach, four
of ’em, and the more I squeezed the more
there didn’t any milk come, and the cow
looked around at me in a pitying sort of
way, but the milk did not arrive on schedule
time, and then I thought of a farmer I once
saw kick a cow in the slats, and I thought
maybe that was the best way to cause the
milk to hurry and flow, so I got up off the
stool and hauled off my hind leg and gave
that cow a swift kick that sent her toes clear
in to her liver and lights and sausage covers.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well I thought it was a car of dynamite
running into an elevator and exploding, but
the boys that picked me up and poured milk
on my face to bring me to, said it was not
an explosion, but that the cow had reared
up in front and kicked up behind, and struck
me with all four feet, and had hooked me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>with her horns, and switched me with her
tail, and pawed me with her forward feet,
and licked my hair with her tongue, and
laid down and rolled on me. Well, I certainly
looked it. Gee, but I don’t want any
more farmer’s life in mine.</p>

<p class='c018'>I certainly thought that was the way to
cause a cow to give milk. Maybe I ought
to have sworn at her the way the farmer
did. I remember now, that he used language
not fit to print, but I have not taken
the swearing degree yet.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, they got me braced up so I could
go to dinner, and it was surely a sumptuous
repast, fried bull heads and bread. I have
eaten fish at home and at hotels, where you
had ketchup, and celery, and vegetables,
and gravy, and pie, and good things, but to
sit down with fifty boys and eat just bull
heads, and stale bread, and try to look pleasant
like you were at a banquet, was one on
your little Hennery that made him feel that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the pleasures of being an orphan had been
over drawn.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gosh, but the boys tell me we have bull
heads here six times a week, because they
don’t cost anything, and that the bones
stick through your skin so they hold your
clothes on.</p>

<p class='c018'>I am organizing a union among the boys
and we are going to call a strike, and if the
pirate with one eye does not grant all we
ask, we are going to walk out in a body, and
jump a freight train, and go out in the wide
world to make our fortunes. I shall go look
for pa. There can’t no man give me such a
dirty shake. I feel like I had been left on
a door step, with a note on the basket asking
the finder to take good care of me “’cause I
was raised a pet.”</p>

<p class='c016'>No Encouragement for Inventive Genius in
<a id='tn028'></a>Orphan Home—The Boy Uses His New
Invention, a Patent Clothes Wringer, in
Milking.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is no encouragement for inventive
genius in this orphans’ home that I am
honoring with my patronage.</p>

<p class='c018'>I always supposed that an orphanage was
a place where they tried to make an orphan
feel that it wasn’t such a great loss not to
have a regular home, among your people as
long as you could be lovingly cared for in
big bunches by charitable people, who would
act like a High School to you, and when you
got a diploma from an orphans’ home you
could go out into the world and hold up
your head like a college graduate, but I can
see from my experience at this alleged home
that when we boys get out the police will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>have a tab on us, and we will be pinched
like tramps.</p>

<p class='c018'>What encouragement is there to learn
anything but being chambermaid to cows?
Gee, but I never want to look a cow in the
face again. When I failed to milk that cow
and she galloped all over the place, and
kicked my liver around where my spleen
ought to be, the one-eyed warden of the
place told me I must practice on that cow
till I got so that I could milk her with my
eyes shut, and that I wouldn’t get much to
eat until I could show him that I was a he-milkmaid
of the thirty-third degree.</p>

<p class='c018'>I told him I saw a machine last year at
the State Fair that had a suction pump that
was put on to the cow’s works, and by
touching a button the milk and honey
flowed into a pail, and if he would get such
a machine I could touch the button all right.
He said the orphanage couldn’t afford to
buy such a machine, but if I wanted to invent
any device to milk cows I could go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>ahead, but it was up to me to produce milk,
one way or another.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, an idea struck me just like being hit
with a base ball bat, and in a short time I
was ready.</p>

<p class='c018'>I got a clothes wringer out of the laundry,
and went to corral the cow. I thought
if a clothes wringer could squeeze the blue
water out of a wash tub of clothes, it would
squeeze a pail of milk out of a cow, so I took
my clothes wringer and the milk pail and got
under the cow and gathered all her four
weiners together in my hands and put the
ends of them between the rubber rollers, just
easy, and the boys gathered round to see
where my inventive genius was going to get
off at. Then when my audience was all
ready to cheer me, if the machine worked, I
took hold of the handle of the machine,
which was across my lap, and turned the
crank with a yuck motion, until all the
cow’s weiners went through between the rollers,
and I noticed the cow flinched, and just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>there one of the sophomore boys threw a
giant firecracker under the cow’s basement
near the milk pail, and when the explosion
came, just when I was cranking her up a
second time and turning on the high speed
clutch, the cow bleated as though she had
lost her calf, and she went up into the air
like the cow that jumped over the moon, and
she went across the country on a cavalry
charge, with me hanging on the handle of
the wringer with one hand, on her tail with
the other, and the boys giving the orphan
school yell, and the cow bellowing like a
whole drove of cattle that have smelled blood
around a slaughter house.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gosh, but I never had such an excursion.
The cow went around the house and on to
the porch where the manager and some
women were, and finally rushed into the
kitchen, and everybody came and tied me
loose from the cow, and got the clothes
wringer off her vital parts, and shooed her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>back to the barn, and then they took me to
the manager’s office, and I fainted away.</p>

<div id='il_3'  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>
<a href='images/airship_pic3.png'><img src='images/airship_pic3.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Gosh, But I Never Had Such an Excursion!</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>When I came to the one-eyed manager
had a bandage over his nose where the handle
of the clothes wringer hit him when he
tried to turn the handle back to release the
pressure on the cow’s bananas, and he was
so mad you could hear him “sis,” like when
you drop water on a hot griddle.</p>

<p class='c018'>He got up and took me by the neck and
wrung it just like I was a hen having its
neck wrung when there is company coming
and he dropped me “kerplunk” and said I
had ruined the best cow on the place by
flattening out her private affairs so that nothing
but skim milk could ever get through the
teats, and he asked me what in thunder I
was doing, milking a cow with a clothes
wringer, when I ought to have known that
a clothes wringer would squeeze the milk
up into the second story of the cow.</p>

<p class='c018'>I told him I had never been a dairy farmer,
anyway, and a cow was a new proposition to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>me, and he said I could go and live on bread
and water till doomsday, and that I was the
worst orphan he ever saw, and he pushed me
out of the room.</p>

<p class='c018'>The boys met me when I came out of the
presence of the one-eyed manager, and we
went off into the woods and held an indignation
meeting, and passed resolutions condemning
the management of the orphanage,
and I suggested that we form a union and
strike for shorter hours and more food, and
if we did not get it, we could walk out, and
make the orphan school business close up.</p>

<p class='c018'>We discussed what we would do and say
to the boss, and just before supper time we
lined up in a body before the house and
called out the manager and made our demands,
and gave him fifteen minutes to accept,
or out we would go, and I tell you we
looked saucy.</p>

<p class='c018'>I never saw anything act as quick as that
strike did. In five minutes the manager
came out and said he wouldn’t grant a thing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>and besides we were locked out, and couldn’t
ever get back into the place unless we
crawled on our hands and knees and stood
on our hind feet like dogs, and barked and
begged for food, and he shut the door and
the dining room was closed in our faces, and
we were told to get off the place or they
would set the dogs on us.</p>

<p class='c018'>For a few minutes not a word was said,
then the boys pitched on to me and another
boy that had brought on the strike, and gave
us a good licking, and made us run to the
woods, and when we got nearly out of sight
we turned and all the brave dubs that were
going to break up the orphanage were down
on their seats on the grass, begging like dogs
to be taken back, because supper was ready,
and my chum and me were pulling for tall
timber, wondering where the next meal was
coming from, and where we are going to
sleep.</p>

<p class='c018'>We were the only boys in that bunch of
strikers that had sand enough to stand up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>for union principles, and as is usually the
case the fellows who had the most gravel in
their crops had little else, and I was never so
hungry in my life.</p>

<p class='c018'>A diet of fried bull heads and skim milk,
and sour bread for a few days in the orphanage
had left me with an appetite that ought
to have had a ten course banquet at once, but
we walked on for hours, and finally struck a
railroad track and followed it to a town.</p>

<p class='c018'>My chum stopped at a freight car on a
side track and began to poke around one of
the oil boxes on a wheel, and when I asked
him what he was going to do, he said that to
a hungry man the cotton waste and the
grease in a hot box of a freight car was just
as good as a shrimp salad, and he began to
poke the stuff out of the hot box to eat it.
He said the lives of tramps were often saved
by eating out of hot boxes. I swore that I
would never eat no hot box banquet, and I
pulled him away from the box car just as a
brakeman came along with a hook and a can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>of oil and a bucket of water to cool it off,
and we escaped.</p>

<p class='c018'>I told him we would have a good supper
all right, if he would stick by me.</p>

<p class='c018'>We went into the little town and it was
getting dark, and all the people were out
doors looking up into the sky, and saying,
“there it is, I see it,” and I asked a man in
front of a saloon what the excitement was
about, and he said that they were watching
the balloons from St. Louis, about two hundred
miles away, which were sailing to the
east.</p>

<p class='c018'>Did you ever have an idea strike you so
sudden that it made you dizzy? Well, I was
struck with one so quick that it made me
snicker, and I pulled my new chum away
and told him how we would get supper and
a place to sleep, and that was to go into the
woods near where the people were looking
up into the air, and when a balloon went
over, after it got good and dark, we could
set up a yell, as though murder was being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>done, and when the crowd came to see what
was the matter, he could say we fell out of
a balloon, and landed in a tree and squirmed
down to the ground.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, I didn’t want to lie, but my chum,
who had once been in a Reform School, did
not care so much about lying, so he was to
do the talking and I was to be deaf and
dumb, as though the fall from the balloon
had knocked me silly.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, when we saw a light in the sky over
us and the people were going wild over
thinking they saw a balloon, we began to
scream like wild cats, and groan like lost
souls, and yell for “help, help.” When the
people came on the run, and when they
found us with our clothes torn, and our hair
standing on end, and our eyes bulging out,
and my chum, the old liar, said when we
were leaning over the basket of the balloon
to see what town we were passing over, we
fell out in a tree, and we were so hungry.</p>

and I hung my legs and arms down so I
would be heavy, and she dragged me to the
house. All I said was, “pie, pie, pie,” and
she said I was starving for pie, and when
they got us in bed, with nice night shirts on,
they crowded around us and began to feed
us, and we took everything from soup to
mints, and went to sleep, and the last thing I
heard was balloon talk, and the woman who
drew me in the shuffle said, “The ways of
Providence are past finding out,” and as I
rolled over in bed I heard my chum in another
bed say “You can bet your sweet
life,” and then the people began to go away,
talking about the narrow escape of those
dear boys, and my pussy fat lady held my
hand and stroked my aching stomach until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>long after midnight, and then she tip-toed
off to bed.</p>

<p class='c018'>I spoke to my chum and said, “Did it work
out all right?” and he groaned and said,
“Gee, but I et too much, I otter have saved
some of it for breakfast,” and then we went
to sleep in nice feather beds instead of those
beds at the orphanage made of breakfast
food.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Boy Escapes from Orphan Asylum—The
Boy and His Chum Had Red Letter
Days—The Boy Is Adopted by New
Friends.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is not much fun in being an orphan
until you escape from the orphan asylum,
and I want to say that my chum and myself
have had two red letter days in the town
where we seemed to drop out of a balloon
into the hearts of the country people.</p>

<p class='c018'>They took up a subscription to buy clothes
for us, and dressed us up, and we looked as
though we had been clothing dummies in
front of a clothing store, and then the people
got into a quarrel as to who should adopt
us.</p>

<p class='c018'>A farmer drew my chum and wanted him
to get acquainted with some mules and
drive six mules to haul fertilizer on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>farm. My chum had to set on a saddle on
one mule, and drive the other five mules by
using one line, which he pulled and hauled
to make them gee round grand right and
left.</p>

<p class='c018'>The fat woman adopted me because I was
such a dear little thing. She was one of
those hay widows, whose husband got plenty
of her sauce, and took to the tall timber,
and all she wanted to do was to hug me, and
tell me that if I had not dropped into her
life, out of that balloon, she would have
kicked the bucket, and I thought of how any
bucket I ever saw would have collapsed, for
she had a foot like a fiddle box.</p>

<p class='c018'>She made me tell her the story of my past
life, and when she found I was Peck’s Bad
Boy, and I thought I had made my story so
sanguinary that she would want me to go
away, so she could have a quiet life, she just
froze to me and said she could see that she
had been selected by Providence to take the
badness out of me, and she went to work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>hypnotizing me, and giving me absent treatment
on my meals, to take my strength for
wickedness away, and then she got me so
weak I could not hug back when she
squeezed me, and you can imagine the condition
a growing boy would be in who could
not do his share of the hugging.</p>

<p class='c018'>The second day of my sentence to be her
adopted son, with all my crimes on my head,
she let me go out on the farm to visit my
chum, and there is where my whole new life
changed.</p>

<p class='c018'>My chum was driving his mules around
the farm, and I was riding behind him on
the wheel mule, when a balloon from St.
Louis came over, and the men in the balloon
yelled to us to grab hold of the rope as they
wanted to land in the field. The mules began
to act up and my chum couldn’t control
them, and I jumped off the mule and grabbed
the rope and gave it a hitch around the pole
of the wagon, and that settled it with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>mules. They rolled their fawn like eyes
around at the great gas bag that was swaying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>over the wagon, with the two men yelling,
and the mules started to run, with the
wagon and the balloon, around that field, the
balloon striking the fence occasionally, and a
tree once in a while, the men yelling for us
to cut the rope, and the mules braying and
saying mule prayers, and me chasing along
to try and cut the rope, and my chum hanging
on to the ears of the wheel mule, and the
farmers rushing into the field from every
direction to stop the mules, and the men in
the balloons using the worst language.</p>

<div id='il_5'  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Grabbed the Balloon Rope and Gave It a Hitch Around the Pole.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The mules had run around the field several
times, and the balloon was doing its best to
keep up, when I yelled to the men in the balloon,
“Why don’t you throw out your anchor?”
and they then seemed to recollect
about the anchor, and they threw it out, and
when it caught fast in the ground the mules
pulled loose from the wagon and went
through a fence, and started for Texas, and
I guess they are going yet. My chum got off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>all right, except he was so scared he could
not stand up. Well, we had a time straightening
things out, the farmers wanted to
lynch the balloon men, and make them pay
for the mules, but in rolling up the balloon
to take to the station, to ship to St. Louis,
I found a mail bag, and I told the farmers
these balloonists were carrying the U. S.
mail, and any man that laid hands on the
government mail could be imprisoned for
life for treason, and I scared the farmers so
they gave the balloonists their dinner, and
hauled the balloon to the station with the
whole bunch of us, and when the balloonists
went away on the train they told my chum
and me that if we would come to St. Louis
they would give us jobs carrying off balloons,
and they would teach us how to fly.
Gee, but that was nuts for us. To rise, at
once, from being mule drivers and adopted
boys, to a place in balloon society, was what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>we wanted, and my chum and I deserted our
more or less happy homes and began to plan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>to jump a freight train bound for St. Louis.</p>

<div id='il_6'  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Any Man That Lays Hands on the Government Mail Can Be Imprisoned for Life for Treason.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>We laid down on the platform of the station
that night and went to sleep and I
dreamed that I sailed across the ocean in a
balloon, and landed in a park in Paris, and
when the populace came to welcome us to
dear old France, Pa was one of the first to
see me, and he fell upon my neck, and when
the people were going to give me a reception,
and a cross of the Legion of Honor, for
being the first to cross the ocean in a balloon,
Pa told them I was his boy, and Pa wanted to
take all the credit for my grand achievement,
and when I woke up a watchman at
the station kicked us off the platform like
we were tramps, and we walked down the
tracks and were so mad we wanted to throw
stones at the switch lights, and my chum
wanted to put a tie on the track to wreck a
train, but I persuaded him that it was that
kind of revenge that caused the enmity between
tramps and the richer class. Then he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>wanted to set fire to a tank car of kerosene,
because Rockafeller owned the railroad, and
the watchman who kicked us was an agent
of the Standard Oil Company. If I hadn’t
been a pretty good citizen there would have
been a bon-fire sure, but I showed my chum
that we were only temporary tramps, and
that in a few days we would achieve success,
and own railroads, and that we should show
an example of patience, and strive to become
members of the four hundred. So we refrained
from getting even, and Rockafeller
was not kept awake by hearing that another
tank car of oil had gone skyward.</p>

<p class='c018'>We were pretty hungry, but tightened up
our belts and pretty soon a freight car
stopped on a side track and a brakeman came
along with a lantern and I gave him the last
half dollar I had and told him we wanted to
land in St. Louis, and he looked us over and
pointed to a car, and we hustled in and he
locked the side door of the car, and we were
alone in the dark, hungry and thirsty.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>We found a part of a bale of hay, and scattered
some on the floor and went to sleep,
and I never slept better on a spring mattress,
but I dreamed of home, and all the fun
I had ever had, making it hot for other people,
playing tricks on them, but now all was
changed, and I felt that I was on my own resources,
making my own way in the world,
handicapped by always having an easy life.</p>

<p class='c018'>Along towards daylight in the morning
some horses began to paw and whinner and
a colly dog began to bark in the car, and
some sheep bleated in the car, and as morning
came, and a little light came in the car,
which was hitting the high places, running
at high speed, so it shook us out of our hay
bed, we looked around starved and stiff,
and sick at heart.</p>

<p class='c018'>When the train stopped I walked through
the car, over bags of oats, and looked at the
horses, and wished I was a horse. The dog
was a watch dog, and when I got near him
he snarled and grabbed a mouthful of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>new pants and held on and shook me, and I
yelled and got away.</p>

<p class='c018'>As it grew lighter I saw a box near the
dog, and in it were some square things that
my practiced eye, as the son of an old hunter,
told me were dog biscuit, a sort of petrified
dough and meat scraps made for high class
dogs that are not allowed to eat scraps from
the table, and I told my chum we would have
breakfast. It took me half an hour to steal
a few dog biscuit away from that dog, and
all the time he was trying to make his breakfast
off of me, but I finally poked out enough
for breakfast, and I called my chum to partake
of the repast. He said he always had
to have some kind of breakfast food before
he ate meat, so I cut into a bag of oats, and
gave him a handful, and there we sat and
chewed away, trying to imagine that we
were happy, and thinking of coffee and pancakes
and sausage, and waffles, and biscuit
and honey.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was probably the worst breakfast ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>eaten by anybody. The dog biscuits were
so hard we had to pound them on the floor
with a currycomb, and that did not help the
flavor much.</p>

<p class='c018'>After breakfast we laid down on the hay
with a horse blanket over us, and slept till
noon, when we heard water being poured into
the tin trough for the horses, and we
quenched our thirst, and ate more dog biscuit,
and I hoped that other boys would hear
of our distress, and that no boys would ever
run away from a happy home again.</p>

<p class='c018'>My chum and I talked over the depression
in the money market, and the panic in Wall
street, and tried to think we were better off
than millionaires who did not know where
the next meal was coming from, and with
our stomachs full, and no care on our minds,
we wished we could give some of our dog
biscuit to the hungry rich.</p>

<p class='c018'>While we were thinking of the good one
can do with a few dog biscuit, there was a
terrible crash, the car jumped on the ties and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>reared up, and finally rolled over and down
a bank and all was still as death, except that
the boiler of the engine was blowing off
steam, and the horses were groaning, and the
confounded dog that chewed me was dead.</p>

<p class='c018'>Men run over the cars, and chopped with
axes, and finally a fire engine began to throw
water on the burning cars, my chum and I
were wedged under bales of hay, one of my
legs was asleep, and we both yelled murder,
and finally the fire was out, the side was
chopped out of the car, and they took us out
and put us in an ambulance and the brakeman
who had let us into the car said, “Tickets,
please,” and the ambulance was driven
to a hospital at East St. Louis, and they
wanted to amputate us, just for practice.
One of the hospital attendants asked me who
I was, and when I told him I was “Peck’s
Bad Boy,” traveling for my health, he said,
“Well, you are certainly getting what is
coming to you,” and I guess that is no lie.</p>

<p class='c016'>A Bad Railroad Wreck—The Boy Contrasts
Their Ride to One in a Parlor Car—The
Lawyer Is the Greatest Man on
Earth—The Boy Settles His Claim for
$20.</p>

<p class='c017'>The accident by the wrecking of the
freight train on which my chum and myself
were touring the country, viewing the scenery
through an auger hole in the side of a
box car, was a darn sight worse than I
thought it was. What a come down it was
for me, who have always traveled with pa,
in a parlor car, to have to ride in a box car,
with live stock, and feast on dog biscuit,
instead of ordering from the menu in a dining
car.</p>

<p class='c018'>No one likes the luxuries of foreign travel
any better than I do, but that freight car
experience showed me that we do not know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>when we are well off, but when a boy goes
out into the world to make his fortune, and
cuts loose from home ties, and pie, and bath
tubs, and a warm bed, and victuals such as
mother makes, and winds up in a wreck,
under a horse that he does not know the
name of, he is going some.</p>

<p class='c018'>When we got to the hospital a lawyer,
who had chased the ambulance on a motorcycle,
retained me as his client and offered
to sue the railway company for a million
dollars damage, and he would furnish all
the evidence, and take half of what he got
for his fee. I thought it was a good proposition,
and probably I can own a railroad if
I take stock for my damages, but I shall take
nothing but money, and let my lawyer have
the railroad stock. Gee, but a lawyer is the
greatest man on earth. This one has been
riding alongside the railroad track on a
motorcycle for years, waiting for an accident,
and when he selected me for a client he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>just cried for joy, and he has drawn a complaint
against the Railroad Company that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>a work of art.</p>

<p><i>Started on a stampede.</i><a id='tn038b'></a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>When he read it to me, and I saw how I
had been broken up and damaged by the
soulless corporation, and how my promising
career had been ruined, I never was so overcome
in my life. While I was not hurt any,
except where the horse laid on me and
squeezed my dog biscuits in my stomach so
my backbone was poulticed by the chewed
biscuit, the lawyer had the doctors at the hospital
put my legs and arms in plaster of paris
casts, and had my body done up in splints
and bandages, and my face covered with
strips of court plaster, until nothing but my
mouth was in working order, and I wore out
a nurse bringing me things to eat, and I
never enjoyed myself more in my life than I
did in that hospital, just eating and being
petted by good looking nurses.</p>

<p class='c018'>My lawyer told me to groan all the time
when anybody was present, and when a railroad
lawyer called at the hospital to take an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>invoice of my wounds, and my lawyer was
present to see that I groaned plenty, it was
all I could do to keep from laughing, but my
lawyer would run a paper knife into my slats
every time I quit groaning, so we were working
the railroad all right, and the hospital
doctors, who were going to have a share in
the money, made a list of my broken bones,
and the railroad lawyer wanted to be shown
every break in my anatomy.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well things went on this way for several
days, and I was getting nervous from the
plaster casts on me.</p>

<p class='c018'>I didn’t like it very much when the railway
lawyer offered to settle for five dollars,
claiming I was a tramp stealing a ride, but
he brought my chum to see me, and my chum
who had his neck twisted around by a bale
of hay falling on him, settled for twenty dollars,
and so I did the same, and when the
nurses were asleep in the afternoon, my
chum and me left the hospital with forty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>good dollars, and started across the bridge
for St. Louis, to find the air ships.</p>

<p class='c018'>We were sitting down on a railroad track,
at the east entrance to the bridge, and I had
taken off my clothes, and was breaking the
plaster of paris off my limbs, when my lawyer
came along on his motorcycle, on the
way to the hospital to make me groan some
more, and when he saw us he had a fainting
spell, and when I told him we had been discharged
cured, he said it was hard for a deserving
lawyer to be knocked out of a half
million dollar fee by a dumb fool client who
didn’t know enough to look out for his own
interests, and he was going to have us arrested
for highway robbery, but I told him
I wouldn’t have known what to do with so
much money if we had kanoodled the railroad
out of a million dollars, in addition to
a free ride on its palatial freight car, and
besides it would be cheating, and the lawyer
drew a long sigh and told us to get out of
the country and he would continue the suit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>on the ground that we had been injured so
bad that we became insane and jumped into
the river, and he offered to throw us in the
river, but we jumped on a street car and went
across to St. Louis in search of the park
where the balloon man was that had offered
us a job riding in balloons.</p>

<p class='c018'>We found the man and he said they were
all going to start for somewhere the next
morning and we could go along, my chum
in one balloon and I in another, and all we
would have to do was to throw out ballast
when told to do so, and open cans of stuff
to eat, and for us to buy thick sweaters, and
show up at nine o’clock in the morning, and
write the address where we wanted our remains
sent to in case we were killed, and pin
the address on our sweaters.</p>

<p class='c018'>It wasn’t cheerful and my chum and I
talked it over until late that night, and I am
sorry to say my chum showed a streak of
yellow, and he confessed to me that he was
a coward, and came from a family of cowards,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>and that he didn’t have sand enough to
go up in a balloon, and he would let me go
up, but he would rather stay on the ground,
where he could feel the earth with his feet,
and watch the balloons.</p>

<p class='c018'>He said that people who go up in balloons
were either crazy, or had met with some disappointment
in life, and took the balloon
method of committing suicide, and he would
side step balloons, and if the time ever came
when he was tired of life, he would take a job
firing on an engine, or go into burglary, or
get in love with some old man’s wife, or
marry a chorus girl, or something that would
be fatal, but on land.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gee, but I was disappointed in my chum.
He had been in a reform school, and I
thought he had gravel in his crop, but he
proved to have the chilblains, and so I went
to the balloon man in the morning alone, and
told him I had made my will, and was ready
to go up to heaven or down to Helena, Arkansas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>any minute he was ready, but my
chum had weakened and gone glimmering.</p>

<p class='c018'>I got in the basket and looked things over,
and jumped out and in several times, and
asked questions of the two men who were to
go up in it, and they seemed pleased that I
was not afraid, and they asked me if I
thought my father would make a kick if I
was killed or lost at sea, or anything, and I
told them from my last conversation with Pa
I thought he would take it as a kindness if
they should find it convenient to spill me out
somewhere or lose me, and when they landed,
if they could make affidavit that I had
been permanently disposed of, like a mess of
kittens under water in a bag, with a stone in
it, that Pa would be willing to cough up quite
a premium.</p>

<p class='c018'>That held them for a little while, and then
they asked me who I was, anyway, and when
I told them that I was the only original
“Peck’s Bad Boy,” they said that from their
recollection of my tricks on my father they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>could readily see how a fatality might be a
blessing, and they seemed relieved of any responsibility,
and we went to work to get
things in the basket, and they instructed me
what I was to do.</p>

<p class='c018'>The basket was about nine feet square, and
it had more things in it than a delicatessen
store.</p>

<p class='c018'>At about ten o’clock in the morning, with
thousands of people watching the balloons,
they began to cut loose and go shooting into
the air, and it was a race.</p>

<p class='c018'>The man told me that the balloon that
went the farthest from St. Louis before being
compelled to land would get the prize,
and I began to feel anxious to have our balloon
win.</p>

<p class='c018'>I watched those that started first, and they
went up so far I could only see little specks
in the sky, and I thought of balloons I had
seen go up on fair grounds, where a girl sat
on a trapeze bar, and jumped off, and a parachute
opened and took her safely to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>ground, and I looked around our balloon for
a parachute, but there was none, and I wondered
what would happen if the balloon
came down, with its gas all escaped, like the
fair ground balloon, and there is where I
came the nearest to weakening and climbing
out, but I thought if I did I would be a coward
like my chum, and then I thought if
those two grown men, with families depending
on them for support, were going up, they
were not doing it for any suicidal purpose,
and I could go if they could, and when the
boss man said, “Now, Bub, if you want to
stay ashore, this is your last chance,” I said,
“Your little Hennery is ready to go where
you go, and you can’t tie her loose any too
soon to suit me,” and he patted me on the
head and said, “Hennery, you sure are
game,” and then all was ready and he said
to them to let go. My heart went up and
rubbed against my palate, and the balloon
made a jump like a horse going over a five
foot fence, advertising a brand of whiskey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>and we shot up into the air, the people yelling,
and I saw my chum sitting on a dray,
driving a mule, and I thought of the difference
between a brave boy and a mucker like
my chum, the houses began to look smaller,
until St. Louis looked like play houses, with
a ribbon of gray on the side of it, which was
the river.</p>

<p class='c018'>The boss looked at a machine and said we
were five miles high, and I thought how I
had always enjoyed high life, and I was trying
to get my heart swallowed down where
it belonged.</p>

<p class='c018'>The balloon basket was as steady as a
house, and I got up and looked over the side
of the basket, and it seemed awful, cause I
had never been higher than the top of a
twenty story building before, and I began
to weep tears, and the air seemed queer, and
I was just going to faint when the boss told
me to open a can of lobsters, and I woke up.</p>

Boy Makes a Trip to San Francisco

<p class='c017'>When our balloon left St. Louis, and got
up in the air so far that the earth looked like
a piece of rag carpet, with pop corn scattered
over it, which were villages, and I realized
that if anything busted, we would be dropping
for hours before we struck a church
steeple, and would be so dead when we hit
the ground, and stiff and cold that we would
be driven down in the mud so far no one
would ever find us, and I looked at the two
fool men in the basket with me, who didn’t
seem to care what became of them, as though
they were unhappily married or had money
in a shaky bank, I began to choke up, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>the tears came to my eyes, and I took a long
breath of thin air, and fainted dead away.</p>

<p class='c018'>When I fainted we were being driven
south, and when I came to, with a smell of
ammonia on my hair, we were going east,
and the balloon had gone down within a
mile of the earth, and the men gave me some
hot tea out of a patent bottle, and pretty soon
I began to enjoy myself and wonder if I
could hit a mess of negroes picking cotton in
a field, with a sand bag.</p>

<p class='c018'>When you are up in the air so far that a
policeman cannot reach you, you feel loose
enough to insult men that would knock your
block off if you should give them any lip
when you were on the ground.</p>

<p class='c018'>We came down a half a mile more, and I
asked the boss man if I might throw a sand
bag at the negroes, and he said I might
throw a bundle of advertisements for liver
pills at them, so I yelled, “Hello, you black
rabbits,” and when the negroes looked up
and saw the balloon, they turned pale, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>dropped on their knees, and I guess they began
to pray, and I didn’t mean to interfere
with their devotions, so I threw a bottle of
ginger ale at a mule hitched to a wagon
near them, and when the bottle struck the
mule on the head and exploded and the ginger
ale began to squirt all over the colored
population, the mule run one way with the
wagon, and the negroes ran for the cane
brakes. The boss man in the balloon complimented
me on being a good shot, and
said I had many characteristics of a true
balloonist, and probably before we got to
the end of the trip I would get so I could
hit a church steeple with a bag of ballast,
and break up a Sunday School in the basement.
He said that being up in the rarefied
air made a man feel as though he would
like to commit murder, and I found out
that was so, for the next town we passed
over, when all the people were out in the
main street, and the balloon man told me to
throw over a bag of sand, so we could go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>up higher, instead of trying to throw the bag
into a field, where there was nobody to be
hurt or frightened, do you know, I shied that
bag at a fountain in the public square and
laughed like a crazy person when the water
splashed all over the crowd, and the fountain
was smashed to pieces, and the pirates
in the balloon complimented me, and yet,
when those men are at home, on the ground,
they are christian gentlemen, they told me,
so I made up my mind that if ballooning became
a fashionable pastime, those who participated
in it would become murderers, and
the people on the ground would shoot at a
balloonist on sight.</p>

<p class='c018'>We went up so high that we were out of
range of people on the ground, so you
couldn’t pick out any particular person to
hit with a bundle of pickle advertisements,
so you had to shoot into a flock, and run
chances of winging somebody, so I did not
enjoy it, but along towards evening we
passed over a town in Tennessee or Kentucky,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>where there was a race track, and
races going on, and just as we got over it I
said to the boss balloon man, “Just watch
me break up that show,” and I pitched overboard
a whole mass of advertisements of different
things we carried, and two bundles
hit the grand stand, and exploded, and about
a million circulars advertising pills and
breakfast food struck the track, just as the
horses were in the home stretch, and of all
the stampedes you ever saw that was the
worst, horses running away, riders fell off,
carriages tipped over, and the people in the
grand stand falling over themselves, and as
we sailed along none of us seemed to care
two whoops whether anybody was killed or
not. It was the craziness of being up in the
air, and not caring for responsibility, like a
drunken chauffeur running a crazy automobile
through a crowd of children, and acting
mad because they were in the way of progress.</p>

<p class='c018'>We laughed and chuckled at the sensation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>we had caused, but cared no more for the results
than a hired girl who starts a fire with
kerosene.</p>

<p class='c018'>It came on dark after a while, and all we
had to do was to look at the stars and the
moon, and it seemed to me that the stars
were as big as locomotive headlights, and
that you could see into them, and on several
of the largest stars I was sure I could see
people moving, and the moon seemed so near
that you could catch the smile of the man in
the moon, and see him wink at you.</p>

<p class='c018'>The two men had to remain awake all
night, but after awhile I said I guessed I
would have my berth made up, and the boss
man handed me a shredded wheat biscuit
for a pillow, and laid me down by the sand
bags and the canned food, and threw a
blanket over me, and I slept all night, sailing
over states, the balloon moving so still
there was no sound at all.</p>

<p class='c018'>I woke up once or twice and listened for a
street car, or some noise to put me to sleep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>again, and found myself wishing there was
a fire, so a fire department would go clanging
by, making a noise that would be welcome
in the terrible stillness.</p>

<p class='c018'>I dreamed the awfulest dreams, and
thought I saw Pa, in another balloon, with
a rawhide in his hand, chasing me, and the
great bear in the heavens seemed to be getting
up on his hind legs, with his mouth
open, ready to hug me to his hairy chest.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a terrible night, and at daylight the
boss man woke me up and I looked over the
side of the basket and we were going across
a piece of water where there were battle
ships lined up like they were at San Diego,
when Cevera’s fleet was smashed, and the
men said now was the time to demonstrate
whether balloons would be serviceable in
case of war, and told me to take a bundle of
malted milk advertisements, and imagine it
was a dynamite bomb, and see if I could land
it on the deck of a big white battleship. I
took a good aim and let the bundle go and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>struck on deck just in front of a cross looking
man in a white uniform, and scattered
all over the deck and the sailors and marines
came up on deck in a wild stampede, and
threw the malted milk advertisements overboard,
and as we sailed on there was an explosion
of red hot language from the cross
looking man in the white uniform, and the
boss balloon man said, “That is a good shot,
Bub, for you landed that bundle of alleged
dynamite square on the deck of Admiral Bob
Evans’ flagship. Didn’t you hear him
swear?” and then we went on, and the man
in the white uniform was shaking his fists
and his mouth was working overtime, but we
couldn’t hear the brand of profanity he was
emitting, but we knew he was going some,
for before we got out of hearing the bugles
were sounding on more than a dozen battleships,
the men came up from below and took
positions in the rigging and everywhere, and
all was live with action, and the boss balloon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>man said the fleet was preparing for its trip
around the horn, to San Francisco, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>I told the balloon man that he couldn’t land
me a minute too quick, because I was going
to join that fleet and go with Bob Evans, if
I never did another thing in my life.</p>

<p>Hit the Chief of Police with a Bottle.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The inspiration came to me up there in the
rarefied air, and I was as sure I was going
around the Horn as though I was already on
one of the ships.</p>

<p class='c018'>We sailed along part of the day and the
gas began to give out, and I had to throw
over ballast, and open cans of food, and bottles
of stuff to drink, and I made some good
shots with the sand bags and the bottles.
Once I hit right in front of a brakeman on a
freight train with a bottle of soda water,
and again I hit an oyster schooner with a
sand bag and must have chuckled at least
a barrel of oysters. The gas kept escaping,
and presently we came down in a field in
Delaware, after I had hit a chief of police in
Wilmington with a bottle of beer, which is a
crime in a prohibition country, and after we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>landed the police arrested the two balloon
men, and tied up the balloon. They paid me
thirty dollars for my services, and I took a
train for Fortress Monroe to join the fleet,
and left the two balloon men on the way to
a whipping post.</p>

Visits the Battleships—They Scour the
Boy With a Piece of Brick and Some
Laundry Soap—The Boy Investigates the
Mechanism of the Battleships—The Boy
Goes With the Ships as a Mascot.</p>

<p class='c017'>When our balloon that sailed from St.
Louis came down in Delaware, and I had
bid good bye to the two men whom I sailed
with, and they had paid me good money
for my services and keeping them awake,
I thought of that fleet we had passed over
at Fortress Monroe, the beautiful white battle ships,
and I was afraid I could not get
there before it sailed, and secure my berth,
as I had made up my mind to go with it
around the horn, and help fight Japan or
mosquitoes, or any old thing that came in
the way, so I took the first train to Fortress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Monroe, and found that the whole population
of several near by states were going
too, as the President was going to review
the fleet before it sailed.</p>

<p class='c018'>The next day I was at the hotel at Old
Point and with hundreds of other people
took a launch and went out among the battle ships.
Everybody was welcome to go
aboard the ships, and we visited several of
them and were shown all over the vessels
by the uniformed jacks.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gee, but a battleship is like a sky scraper
on land, and you can go from the roof clear
down half a mile below the water line, and
it is like a combination of an engine manufactory,
a boiler plant, a coal yard, a wholesale
grocery, a packing house, a blacksmith
shop, a department store, a hotel, a powder
mill, a suburban trolley line, and a bargain
sale of blankets, a state fair and a military
encampment, and a parade ground, a county
jail and an apartment house, with rooms to
let on the European plan and all of it in an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>iron coffin, liable to go to the bottom any
minute, if the air tanks are punctured.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gee, but I was almost afraid to be down
cellar in a battleship without any life preserver,
and when I went up on deck, where
I could jump overboard if she began to sink,
there, away on top of the whole old cook
stove, were guns so big that it seemed if
one got to moving around on deck it would
tip the ship over. It seemed to me like boring
a hole in a flat iron and crawling in, and
being put in a bath tub, or like rigging up
a coal stove with paddles and outriggers,
and paddling out in a marsh duck shooting.</p>

<p class='c018'>The first hour I was investigating the
mechanism of a battleship and was scared
silly for fear she would get ready to sink,
and as I looked at the iron everywhere,
which I had been taught in school would
sink so quick it would make your head swim,
I wondered what my nation could be thinking
of to build ships of iron and depend on
wind to keep them on top of the water, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>I thought it would be just as safe to cover
an iron railroad bridge with building paper,
and launch it for a trip across the ocean;
and yet all the officers and men seemed to
enjoy it, and forget about the danger, for
they laughed and played jokes, and put on
airs, and mashed the girls who came on
board as though they had made up their
minds that it was only a matter of time
when the ships would sink, and they seemed
to congratulate themselves that when they
went down with the ships a time lock would
close them up hermetically so sharks and
devil fish couldn’t eat the crew, and they
could float around for all time and eternity
safe from the resurrection as they would be
buried in a safety deposit box in the vault
of a trust company.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some of the jacks played it on me. They
took me and wrapped an angora goat skin
around me, with the hair outside, and tied
a string to my feet, and run it out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>breach of the big sixteen inch gun, and another
string on my legs, and they pulled me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>back and forth through that forty foot gun
to swab it out, and when I came out alive
they laughed and were going to tie a bag of
shot to my feet and let me off a plank over
the side to practice on a burial at sea, but
I yelled for help and a cross looking man
came along and pardoned me, and told the
fellows to take me to his cabin and wash the
powder off my face, and hold me until he
could have a talk with me. When they had
scoured me with a piece of brick and some
yellow laundry soap, the man came into the
cabin, and the boys who had hazed me said
he was Admiral Evans, and I remembered
him cause once when he was in the light
house service he entertained Pa and me on
his light house tender, and held me on his
lap at the New Orleans Mardi Gras, and I
said, “Hello, Mr. Evans, don’t you remember
little Hennery? I am Peck’s Bad Boy,”
and he remembered me, and said, “What
n’ell you doing here?” and I told him I knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>what he was up against, going around the
horn, and to San Francisco and Japan and
the Philippines, and that I wanted to go
along on his ship as a mascot, or a waiter or
anything, and he said he didn’t know, but
I would be a good mascot, as last trip they
had a goat and a monkey for mascots, and
I had a combination of both, and if he was
going to make a trip to hades, or any climate
hotter than the straits of Magellan,
he thought I would be all right.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>They Pulled Me Through That Forty-Foot Gun to Swab It Out.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>He asked me what I could do and I told
him there was nothing that I couldn’t do if
properly encouraged, anything, from flying
a flag of truce from the fighting top, to riding
up in the ammunition elevator with five
hundred pounds of dynamite, to acting as
the propeller to a Whitehead torpedo.</p>

<p class='c018'>We talked it over for an hour and he
asked about Pa, and then he said he would
think it over, and he gave me a ticket with
a number on, and told me to be on the front
porch of the Hotel Chamberlaine at nine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>o’clock the second morning after, and if a
steam launch from the Connecticut landed
there and gave two whistles, for me to get
on board with my baggage, and report to
him before the fleet sailed.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, say, this was quick work, and I
called a launch and visited the other vessels,
promising to be Johnny on the spot at the
appointed hour.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a great sight to see the review,
when the President came along on the yacht
Mayflower and I forgot all about the battleships
being of iron liable to sink if the wind
got out of the tanks, and was never so proud
in my life as I was when I saw the jacks
climb up on the rigging and hang on like
monkeys, lined up like they were drilling
on deck, and when the Connecticut began
to fire a salute to the President, out of those
great iron sewer pipes, and all the rest of
the fleet began to shoot at the air, the noise
was so loud that it made your head feel like
you do when you take seidletz powders, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>it gullups up your nose, and the smokeless
powder made the smoke so thick you
couldn’t see anything but the President’s
teeth, as he sailed along on his yacht, and
I got so patriotic that the chills went up my
back like when you have the grip coming
on, and then the smoke cleared away and
when a million American flags were flung
to the breeze, I began to choke up like you
do when you are sick and the callers say,
“Well, brace up boy, you may pull through,
but there are a hundred chances against
your living till morning,” and the tears
rolled down my cheeks, and my throat got
full like I had the tonsilitis, and everybody
else on our launch except two Japanese
were crying, and then the President’s yacht
took a position, and all the battleships swinging
into line and marched past, and the
bands played, and we all just bellered for
patriotic joy, and I was so mad to see those
Japanese standing there like bottles of castor
oil, not even smiling, that I blew up a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>toy balloon which I have been playing air
ship with, and I whacked it on the head of
the meanest looking Jap, and when it exploded
he was the scardest-looking person
I ever saw, because he thought one of those
sixteen-inch shells had gone off in his hat,
and everybody said, “served him right,”
and then he laughed, the first time since the
review started, and he wanted the skim of
my toy balloon as a souvenir of the first
gun fired in the war with Japan.</p>

<p><a id='tn087b'></a>When it Exploded the Jap Was the Scaredest Person I Ever Saw.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>From that day, when I had examined critically
our fleet and seen it salute, and monkey
around the President, I felt so patriotic
that I wanted to fight for my country, and
I could hardly wait two days for Mr. Evans
to send his launch ashore after me, and I
didn’t care if the whole thing was iron, that
couldn’t float under natural conditions and
if Bob Evans should put oarlocks on a bar
of railroad iron, and put me on it, with orders
to go sink a Japanese sampon, or whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>they call their war ships, I would step aboard
that bar of railroad iron with a light heart,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>wave my hat and tell them all to go plumb.</p>

<p class='c018'>So we went ashore, and that evening there
was a ball at the hotel, and all the officers
of the navy were there, and the army, and
millions of ladies with clothes on the lower
half of them, and talcum powder and black
court plaster on the upper half, and the way
they danced and waltzed and flirted and et
lobsters would make you dizzy, and when
Bob Evans walked limping by me, with a
two-hundred-pound lady on one arm, and a
ninety-pound girl on the rheumatiz side of
him, I was so full of patriotic fire I couldn’t
help saying, “Hello, Bob, I will be on deck
all right,” and he looked at me with an expression
on his face that looked as though
he had drawn a lobster that had been dead
too long, and he marched along with his female
procession, and the orchestra struck
up a good-night waltz, and everybody
waltzed, and took some drinks, and went
home to wait the sailing of the fleet the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>next day, and I went to bed with an order
to be called at sunrise, so I could be on the
porch with my ticket in my hand, ready to
jump into the launch when she whistled and
sail away “for a frolic or a fight,” and I
didn’t care which.</p>

<p class='c017'>I feel like a bridegroom that has been
left waiting at the church, with no bride
appearing, and the crowd scoffing at him,
and commenting on his clothes.</p>

<p class='c018'>I waited on the porch of the hotel at Fortress
Monroe all the forenoon for Mr. Evans’
launch to come and get me and take me
aboard his gladship, holding my ticket in
one hand and my bundle of clothes in the
other.</p>

<p class='c018'>Launches came by the dozen, bringing
people ashore, but no one was allowed to go
out to the ships. Finally the last launch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>came, and it was manned by “Connecticut”
men, and when I showed my ticket and was
going to get on, the boss said “skiddoo,”
the boat moved away with one of my feet
on board and the other on the dock, and I
promptly fell in the water, the boss of the
boat yelled to some one on the dock to “get
a boat hook and pull it out,” and soon I
came up strangling, a hook caught me in
the pants and I was hauled out on the
dock, they rolled me on a barrel and
stood me on my head to empty the water
out of me, and a soldier took me into
the kitchen of the hotel to have me dried
out by the gas boiler, and I felt deserted
and demoralized. The guns boomed, the
bands played, and I looked out of the
kitchen window and saw the fleet sail away
south without me, and I realized that Bob
Evans had been “stringing” me, and that
he never intended I should go around the
horn with the fleet, and I thought that may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>be, if he was a liar, and used profane language,
and was subject to rheumatism, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>was better that I did not go, as I might be
spoiled. But they can go plumb with their
old fleet, and if the Japs get Bob Evans and
roast him over the coals, all I hope is that he
will be sorry for treating me as he did.</p>

<p>The Boss of the Boat Ordered Me Pulled Out with a Boat Hook.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>But I always light on my feet. After I
got dried out, I met a man who was picking
up a crew to go to Europe from Baltimore
on a cattle ship, and he pictured to me the
easy life on the ocean wave with a load of
steers, and hired me to go along, and I
thought it was the chance of my life to meet
up with Pa, who is over there hunting airships
for his government, so we went to
Baltimore, and that night we were in the
cattle ship and I slept in a hammock and
ate my bread and beef out of a tin basin.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gee, what a change it was over my former
trip to Europe with Pa, on a regular liner,
with a bed and meals in the cabin. But
when a boy goes out in the world to gain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>his own living, and travel on his face, he
has got to take what comes to him.</p>

<p class='c018'>The next morning my work began. Our
vessel went up to the stock yards, and began
to load steers for shipment, and all I had
to do was to act as a “twister.” When the
cattle came through the shute, and landed
on the deck, and refused to go into the dark
places, we had to take hold of the tails of
the cattle and twist them so they would
move on, and of all the bellowing you ever
heard, that was the worst.</p>

<p class='c018'>Whether the bellowing was caused by the
tail twisting, or because the cattle were
home sick, and did not want to be kidnapped
or “shonghaid” on board a foreign-bound
vessel, I don’t know, but it was more
exciting than the sea fight at Santiago and
about as dangerous, for the cattle hooked
with their horns and kicked, and I was
kicked more than forty times, and would
have quit, only the man that hired me said
if any of us were injured we would be put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>on the government pension list, and be supported
in luxury the balance of our lives, so
I worked for two days, and finally we got a
thousand or more steers down in the hold,
sliding them down on skids, and they were
lined up in stalls, with a hay rack in front of
them, and a bar across behind them, and we
sailed for the ocean, after feeding the cattle
bailed hay and giving them water and bedding.</p>

<p class='c018'>It seemed to me those cattle were almost
as comfortable as steerage passengers on a
liner, but they kicked and bellowed, and
pawed the planks off the deck, and mourned
like lost souls.</p>

<p class='c018'>The first day out I found that I was not a
passenger, but a crew. Instead of the easy
life I had expected, loafing along across the
ocean, I had to get up before daylight and
skin potatoes, and help stir soup, and pulverize
hard tack, and carry the food up into
the cabin for the officers, and be sea sick,
and wash dishes and wait on table, and feed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>cattle, and do everything anybody told me
to do. After a few days I mutinied, and
went to the captain and complained. He was
an English nobleman, and after hearing my
tale of woe, he told me if I didn’t like it I
could go to ’ell, and I went down cellar to
the cook room, which was the nearest to
’ell I could go on that vessel. I found the
man that hired me, and told him I seemed
to be doing the most of the work on the
excursion, and that I wanted an assistant.
He said if I thought I was working much
now, I better wait until we run into a storm,
when I would not only have to be cook and
waiter and chamber maid to the steers, but
I would have to be trained nurse down in
the cattle regions, for when the steers began
to be sea sick that was a time when any
man who had a heart could use it to the best
advantage, for there was nothing more pitiful
than a steer with a pain under his belt.
He said steers were not at all like the Irishman
who was on the bow of the boat on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>last trip, feeding the fish, when the captain
came along and said, “Pat, your stomach
seems to be weak,” and Pat said, “O, I dunno,
I am throwing it as far as any of them.”
He said when there was a storm at sea the
animals acted perfectly human. They would
get down on their knees and roll their eyes
heavenward, and moan, and cry, and tears
would be in their eyes, but they never lost
their cud, only they swelled up and bellowed.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, it wasn’t an hour before a storm
came from towards Cuba, and the boat was
rocking and pitching, and the captain blew
three whistles, which was a signal for all
hands to go below and nurse the steers, and
we all made a rush down to the very bowels
of the ship, where the cattle were, and
such a sight I never saw.</p>

<p class='c018'>Every steer was standing on one leg and
then another, pitching forward into the
manger, and then back against the bar that
held them in the stall, and all bellowing as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>though their hearts would break, and the
duty of the crew was to go in the stalls and
throw the cattle down on their sides, and
tie their legs so they couldn’t get up, when
they could lie there and ride easy.</p>

<p class='c018'>They sent me into a stall where a steer
was slowly dying by inches, with instructions
to hold up his left foreleg, so they could
throw him, and just as I had raised the leg
they threw him onto me, and went on to
the next stall, leaving me with the wind all
jammed out of me, and the haunch of the
steer holding me down.</p>

<p class='c018'>They went all through the lower deck,
got the steers down, and went off and left
me there to die, never seeming to miss me.
I have slept with a good many different
kinds of people and things in my time. I
have had a porcupine crawl into bed with
me when camping in the North woods, and
he was rough enough, for sure. I once had
a skunk come into a tent where some of us
boys were camping, and when the skunk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>found out who we were he didn’t do a thing
and all the boys said it was me, and they
kicked me out, and made me sleep with the
dogs, until the dogs struck, when I was
lonely enough.</p>

<p class='c018'>Once I had a snake get under my blanket
and shake his rattles, and I got out of the
tent so quick the snake never knew I was
there, but in my wildest moments of seeking
for new experiences, I never thought I
should be a pillow for the stomach of a sea
sick thousand-pound steer.</p>

<p class='c018'>When I got my breath so I could yell it
was night, and I had probably been under
that steer for several hours. I tried to kick
the steer in a vital part, where ox drivers
kick oxen to make them “haw” and “gee,”
but the steer had gone to sleep and never
paid any attention to me.</p>

<p class='c018'>I guess everybody had gone to sleep on
the ship, except the watchman and the pilot,
but I could lay there all night, so I began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>to make a noise like a ghost, and I wailed so
the watchman heard me, and he peered down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>the hatch, and I mumbled, “I am thy father’s
ghost,” and I rubbed some phosphorus
I had in my pocket on the hair of the steer
that was acting as my bed clothes. The man
skipped, and pretty soon he came back with
the English captain, who had told me if I
didn’t like my job I could go to ’ell, and
when he saw the shining steer with the
phosphorus on its hair, I wailed and said,
“This is ’ell, come in, the water is fine, and
I smell the blood of an Englishman.”</p>

<div id='il_12'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/airship_pic12.png'><img src='images/airship_pic12.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“I Am Thy Father’s Ghost!—Come on in, the Water’s Fine!—I Smell the Blood of an Englishman!”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Well, the captain weakened, and wouldn’t
come down, but I heard bells ringing all over
the boat, like a fire alarm, and pretty soon
the whole crew came down cellar with hose
and began to squirt water on the steer and
me, and the steer was so scared it broke the
rope on its legs and got up off me, and then
the animal stampeded out of the stall and
charged the firemen, and rubbed its phosphorus
side against the English captain, and
he thought he was in hell, for sure, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>made them turn the hose on him, and then
a man hit the steer in the head with an ax,
and the trouble was over, except that the
captain laid it all to me, and told the crew
I was a “’oodoo,” and they searched me and
found my phosphorus, and that settled it
with me.</p>

<p class='c018'>They were ordered to put me in the dungeon,
and when they were going up stairs
I heard the captain say, “At daylight ’oist
it h’out of the ’old, and chuck it h’over board
to feed the sharks,” so I guess I can see my
finish all right.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>The Boy Dresses Up in His Sunday Clothes
and Tells the Captain He Is Ready to Die—The
Crew Throw a Steer Overboard to
Feed a School of Sharks—The Boy Produces
His New Electric Battery—The
Bad Boy Makes a Trip to France to Meet
His Pa.</p>

<p class='c017'>I never slept a wink that night after the
phosphorus episode, which I painted the
wild steer so it looked like a four-legged
ghost, and scared the crew so they nearly deserted
the ship, because the captain ordered,
as I supposed, that I be cast overboard the
next morning, to give the sharks a meat
sandwich, and all night I tried to prepare
myself for death, though I could not help
thinking that in some way I would escape.</p>

<p class='c018'>The next morning I got up and collected
all the shoes of the officers and got a blacking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>brush and began blacking them. Soon
there was trouble, because every man missed
his shoes, and they began to hunt for them,
and they found me working at the shoes and
singing, “Pull for the shore, brother,” and
such pious hymns.</p>

<p class='c018'>I was dressed up in my Sunday clothes,
and when the captain got his shoes he
wanted to know what was the meaning of
my sudden industry, and the funeral aspect
all around, and I told him I had heard him
tell the crew to chuck me overboard, and I
was preparing myself for death, and I gave
him a letter to mail to Pa, after I was gone,
and told the captain I was ready. “Why,
you dumb fool,” said the captain, “it was
not you I meant to throw overboard, but
that phosphorus steer that we killed last
night. They are hauling it up out of the
hold now with the tackle. We will save you
for a worse fate.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, I never felt so happy in my life as
I did when that dead steer came up through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the hatchway, and was launched over the
side, and when I saw the flock of sharks
jump on the steer and begin to hunt for the
tenderloin, I let out a yell for joy that
sounded like the cry of a timber wolf.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then I got what was coming to me. The
captain gave me a swat across the jaw for
making noise enough to scare the crew into
mutiny, the mate gave me a kick when I
started for the cook’s galley, and several of
the under officers hit me, and by the time
I got my apron on to help cook dinner I
was bruised and mad, and decided to get
even with the captain. I am a peaceful citizen
until somebody walks on my frame, then
I become a terror to the foe.</p>

<p class='c018'>When we began to fry the beef for dinner
I told one of the crew that it was a shame
to feed men on steer meat, when the steer
had died in its stall of Texas fever or rhinderpest,
and before we got the meat cooked,
ready for the dinner of the officers and crew,
every man but the officers had talked over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>the dead steer, and resolved that they would
not eat it, and when they sat down to the
table, and I began to bring in the meat, they
all looked like a mob of anarchists ready to
murder somebody, and I helped all I could
by saying in a whisper, “This is perfectly
good meat, but this is a good day to fast,
and you will live longer.” The officers at the
other end of the cabin were eating the steer
all right, but the crew never touched it, confining
themselves to the bread and coffee,
and pretty soon one of the crew proposed
that they show their displeasure by taking
the meat and throwing it at the officers.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, if I live a million years I will never
have so much fun again. About thirty men
got up and grabbed the meat I had put on
their plates, and began to throw it at the
captain and mate, and all the officers, and
of all the greasy mess I ever saw, that was
the worst. The captain got up on a chair
and pulled a revolver, and asked what was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>the cause of the assault, and was going to
shoot, when the crew drew revolvers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>told him that if he pulled a trigger they
would annihilate every officer on the boat,
and take charge of it themselves, and run it
into the first port. He said the crew could
stand anything except eating diseased cattle,
and that they drew the line at steers that
had died of rhinderpest.</p>

<div id='il_13'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/airship_pic13.png'><img src='images/airship_pic13.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Captain Got Up on a Chair and Pulled a Revolver and Was Going to Shoot.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The captain was stunned, and said the
beef flying through the air was good, and he
got it from cold storage in Baltimore, and
asked that a committee go with him down
in the hold and see the evidence, and a committee
was appointed to go down and see
about it.</p>

<p class='c018'>When they came back they were satisfied,
and the captain asked them how they got
the idea the meat was bad, and when it came
to that I felt as though some one would
squeal on me, and as I started to make a
get away, and hide somewhere until the
storm blew over, one of the crew took me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>by the neck and said to the captain, “This
young man told us about the meat.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The captain told the fellow that had me
collared to take me to his cabin, and he came
in pretty mad, and called in a few officers,
and they were getting ready to kill me, when
I thought of the little electric battery in my
pistol pocket.</p>

<p class='c018'>It is one I got in St. Louis to scare people
with. I can turn a button, and the battery
will send electricity into my arm and
through my body, and I turned the dingus,
and felt the electricity going through me
like ginger ale up your nose, and when
they had got ready to maul me I began to
weep, and told the captain I was no saint,
but I wanted a quiet life, and all the fun I
could have, and I asked him as a special favor
to allow me to shake his hand before
I died, as I knew my earthly career was
about done for, and by that time the battery
was buzzing, and I reached out my hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>to shake his. He gave me his hand, and
when I began to squeeze his hand the electricity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>went up his arm so he turned pale,
and I hung on and he yelled to the officers
to take me off, as I was killing him, and the
sweat stood out on his face.</p>

<div id='il_14'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/airship_pic14.png'><img src='images/airship_pic14.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>I Gave Him a Squeeze That Sent a Shock Through Him That Loosened His Teeth.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The mate grabbed hold of me and I gave
him my other hand and he began to dance,
and the three of us were as full of electricity
as a trolley wire. I hung on and made them
get down on their knees and swear they
would not lick me, and then I let go of them
and began to weep again, and they were
sorry for me.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then they made me tell them who I was,
and that I was going to France to meet Pa,
and monkey with air ships, and when they
were sure I was Peck’s Bad Boy they said
I could have the free run of the ship and
that I had the right to play all the tricks
on anybody that I wanted to.</p>

<p class='c018'>They made me show them how I worked
my little pocket battery and then they
wanted me to shake hands with all the crew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>so they got the whole bunch in the cabin
and the captain said they had been entertaining
an angel unawares, and that I was
the original Bad Boy, who had traveled all
over Europe and met the crowned heads,
and he wanted to introduce me to each
member of the crew personally, as a distinguished
guest who honored the ship by being
on board. Then he began to pass them
up to be shook by the great and only.</p>

<p class='c018'>The first fellow to put out his hand was a
Greek, who drew a knife on me once because
the coffee was weak, and I gave him a
squeeze that sent a shock through his system
that loosened his teeth, and when the captain
alluded to me as the angel child who was
loaded for fear, and who had a charmed life
that could not be destroyed by knives or
guns, the Greek looked at me in a respectful
way as though he didn’t want to have any
more truck with me.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then a big Welshman came up and shook
my hand, and when I gave him the third
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>degree he let go and jumped out of the
window of the cabin, on deck, and began to
use language that was equal to Russian, and
then a Swede came bowing to me, thinking
I must be at least a crown prince, and when
I squeezed his hand he looked at his fingers
and his arm, and trembled and squirmed and
said, “Ah tank a got yim yams,” and he lit
out in a hurry.</p>

<p class='c018'>A small Irishman came next, and as he
was the one who promised to cut my ears
off to serve on toast, I gave him the limit,
and he curled up like a German dockshound
and laid down to the mat, making motions
with his mouth as though he was repeating
poetry, and he said, “Kape away from me,
ye hoodoo,” and he crawled out so quick it
almost broke the door.</p>

<p class='c018'>The captain and mate laughed every time
I shook hands with any of the crew, and
when I had paralyzed them all, and got them
so scared they would come to me if I
whistled, and eat out of my hand, the captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>said I was worth more towards maintaining
discipline on the boat than a whole police
force, and he wanted me to do something
every day to keep the crew from being
lonely, so that night at supper time I
charged all of the steel knives and forks with
electricity and got two nigger chasers ready
for business.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was to be the last night before we
landed in France, and I was prepared to
make it a meal long to be remembered. I
sat next to the captain, and that brought me
right close to the crew’s table, and when the
crew filed in and took their places, they all
looked at me as though I was the devil instead
of an “angel child.”</p>

<p class='c018'>I had a match all ready and when the
supper was put on and the crew grabbed
their knives and forks they were shocked
real hard, and they dropped them and yelled
something like the swear words of each nationality,
and then I put my nigger chasers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>down on the floor, headed for the crew’s
table, and lit the fuse.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, you know how nigger chasers will
chase. Gee, but they went under the crew’s
table, smoking and hissing, the sparks flew,
and the brave crew got up and run out on
deck yelling “fire,” and “murder,” and “dam
that boy,” and the man in charge of the fire
hose turned it into the cabin and drowned
everything out, and the crew run away and
hid, and when things cleared off the captain
said, “Boy, I like a joke as well as anybody,
but you have overdone this thing, and I
am mighty glad we land tomorrow, and you
can go to your Pa and his confounded airships,
and may the Lord have mercy on
him.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Then we went to bed, and I expected some
of the crew would stab me before morning,
but I guess they were too much rattled.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gee, but I am dying to see Pa, and help
him spend government money for eatings,
seems as though I haven’t had a square meal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>since my chum and I struck that community
near St. Louis, as escaped balloonaticks.<a id='tn117'></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Pa has had the hardest time of his life in
Paris, and if I ever pitied a man it was
Pa.</p>

<p class='c018'>You see, that last fly in the airship pretty
near caused him to cash in his chips, and
go over the long road to the hereafter,
cause he got blood poison from the thorns
that run into him where he landed in the
top limbs of the thornapple tree, and he
sprained his arm and one hind leg while being
taken down with a derrick, and then
before we left the country town for Paris
he drank some goat’s milk, which gave him
ptomaine poison in his inside works, and a
peasant woman who sewed up his pants
where they were torn on the tree pricked
him with a needle, and he swelled up so he
was unable to sit in a car seat, and his face
was scratched by the thorns of the tree and
there were blotches all over him, so when
we got to Paris the health officers thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>he had smallpox and sent him to a pest
house, and they wouldn’t let me in, but
vaccinated me and turned me loose, and I
went to the hotel and told about where Pa
was, and all about it, and they put our baggage
in a sort of oven filled with sulphur
and disinfected it, and stole some of it, and
they made me sleep in a dog kennel, and
for weeks I had to keep out of sight, until
Pa was discharged from the hospital, and
the friends of Pa out at the airship club in
the country got Pa’s airship that he bought
for a government out of the tree and took
it to the club and presented a bill for two
hundred dollars, and I only had seven dollars,
so they held it for ransom.</p>

<div id='il_15'  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Pa’s Face Was Scratched So They Sent Him to the Pest House.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Gee, but I worried about Pa!</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, one day Pa showed up at the hotel
looking like he had been in a railroad
wreck, and he was so thin his clothes had
to be pinned up with safety pins, and he had
spent all his money, and was bursted.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>The man who hired Pa in Washington to
go abroad and buy airships for the government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>told Pa to use his own money for a
month or two and then draw on the secretary
of the treasury for all he needed, so
before Pa went to the hospital he drew on
his government for ten thousand dollars,
and when he came back there was a letter
for him from the American Consul in Paris
telling him to call at the office, so Pa went
there and they arrested him on the charge
of skull dugging. They said he had no
right to draw for any money on the government
at Washington. Pa showed his
papers with the big seal on, and the consul
laughed in Pa’s face, and Pa was hot under
the collar and wanted to fight, but they
showed him that the papers he had were
no good, and that he had been buncoed by
some fakir in Washington who got five
hundred dollars from Pa for securing him
a job as government agent, and all his
papers authorized him to do was to travel
at his own expense, and to buy all the airships
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>he wanted to with his own money, and
Pa had a fit. All the money he had spent
was a dead loss, and all he had to show for
it was a punctured airship, which he was
afraid to ride in.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa swore at the government, at the consul,
and at the man who buncoed him, and
they released him from arrest, when he
promised that he would not pose any more
as a government agent, and we went back
to the hotel.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Well, this is a fine scrape you have got
me in,” says Pa, as we went to our room.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What in thunder did I have to do about
it?” says I, just like that. “I wasn’t with
you when you framed up this job and let
a man in Washington skin you out of your
money by giving you a soft snap which has
exploded in your hands. Gee, Pa, what
you need is a maid or a valet, or something
that will hold on to your wad.” Pa said he
didn’t need anybody to act as a guardian to
him, cause he had all the money he needed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>in his letter of credit to the American Express
Company in Paris, and he knew how
to spend his money freely, but he did hate
to be buncoed and made the laughing stock
of two continents.</p>

<p class='c018'>So Pa and I went down to the Express
Office, and Pa gave the man in charge a
paper and the grand hailing sign of distress,
and he handed out bags of gold and bales
of bills, and Pa hid a lot in his leather belt,
and put some in his pockets, and said, “Come
on, Henry, and we will see this town, and
buy it if we like it.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, we went out after dark and took
in the concert halls and things, and Pa drank
wine and I drank nothing but ginger ale,
and women who waited on us sat in Pa’s
lap and patted his bald head, and tried to
feel in his pockets, but Pa held on to their
wrists and told them to keep away, and he
took one across his knees and slapped her
across the pajamas with a silver tray, and
I thought Pa was real saucy.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>A head waiter whispered to me and
wanted to know what ailed the old sport,
and I told him Pa was bitten with a wolf in
our circus last year, and we feared he was
going to have hydrophobia, and always
when these spells come on the only thing
to do was to throw him into a tank of
water, and I should be obliged to them if
they would take Pa and duck him in the
fountain in the center of the café, and save
his life.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa was making up with the girl he had
paddled with the silver tray, buying champagne
for her and drinking some of it himself
out of her slipper, when the head waiter
called half a dozen Frenchmen who were
doing police duty, and told them to duck
Pa in the fountain, and they grabbed him
by the collar and the pants and made him
walk turkey towards the fountain, and he
held on to the girl, and the Frenchmen
threw Pa and the girl into the brink with a
flock of ducks, and they went under water,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>and Pa came up first yelling murder, and
then the girl came up hanging to Pa’s
neck, and she gave a French yell of agony,
and Pa gave the grand hailing sign of distress,
and yelled to know if there was not
an American present that would protect
an American citizen from the hands of a
Paris mob. The crowd gathered around
the circular fountain basin and one drunken
fellow jumped in the water and was going
to hold Pa’s head under water while
the girl found his money, when Pa yelled
“Hey, Rube,” the way they do in a circus
when there is a fight, and by ginger it
wasn’t a second before half a dozen old circus
men that used to belong to the circus
when Pa was manager in the States made
a rush for the fountain, knocked the Frenchmen
galley west, and pulled Pa out of the
water and let him drain off, and they said,
“Hello, old man, how did you happen to let
them drown you?” and Pa saw who the boys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>were and he hugged them, and invited
them to all take something and then go to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>his hotel.</p>

<p>After Pa Had Been Ducked in the Fountain They Charged for Two Ducks He Killed by Falling on Them.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>When Pa paid the check for the drinks
they charged in two ducks they said Pa
killed in the tank by falling on them. But
Pa paid it and was so tickled to meet the
old circus boys that he gave the girl he
went in swimming with a twenty-franc
note, and after staying until along towards
morning we all got into and on top of a
hack and went to the hotel and sat up till
daylight talking things over.</p>

<p class='c018'>We found the circus boys were on the
way to Germany to go with the Hagenbach
outfit to South Africa to capture wild animals
for circuses, and when Pa told the
boss, who was one of Hagenbach’s managers,
about his airship and what a dandy
thing it would be to sail around where the
lions and tigers live in the jungle, and lasso
them, from up in the air, out of danger, he
engaged Pa and me to go along, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>guess we will know all about Africa pretty
soon.</p>

<p class='c018'>The next day we went out to the club
where Pa keeps his airship, with the boss
of Hagenbach’s outfit and a cowboy that
used to be with Pa’s circus, to practice lassoing
things. They got out the machine
and Pa steered it, and the boss and I were
passengers, and the cowboy was on the railing
in front with his lariat rope, and we
sailed along about fifty feet high over the
farms, until we saw a big goat. The cowboy
motioned for Pa to steer towards the
goat, and when we got near enough the
cowboy threw the rope over the goat’s
horns and tightened it up, and Mr. Goat
came right along with us, bleating and fighting.
We led the goat about half a mile over
some fences, and finally came down to
the ground to examine our catch, and we
landed all right, and Hagenbach’s boss
said it was the greatest scheme that ever
was for catching wild animals, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>doubled Pa’s salary, and said we would
pack up the next day and go to the Hagenbach
farm in Germany and take a steamer
for South Africa in a week.</p>

<p class='c018'>They were talking it over, and the cowboy
had released the goat, when that animal
made a charge with his head on our
party. He struck Pa below the belt, butted
the boss in the trousers until he laid down
and begged for mercy, stabbed the cowboy
with his horns, and then made a hop, skip
and jump for the gas bag, burst a hole in
it, and when the gas began to escape the
goat’s horns got caught in the gas bag and
the goat died from the effects of the gas,
and we were all glad until about fifty peasant
women came across the fields with agricultural
implements, and were going to
kill us all.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa said, “Well, what do you know about
that?” but the women were fierce and
wanted our blood. The boss could talk
French and he offered to give them the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>goat to settle it, but they said it was their
goat anyway, and they wanted blood or
damages.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa said it was easier to give damages
than blood, and just as they were going to
cut up the gas bag the boss settled with them
for about twenty dollars, and hired them to
haul the airship to the nearest station, and
we shipped it to Berlin, and got ready to
follow the next day.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa says we will have a high old time in
Africa. He says he wants to ride up to a
lion’s den in his airship and dare the fiercest
lion to come out and fight, and that he
wouldn’t like any better fun than to ride over
a royal Bengal tiger in the jungle, and reach
down and grab his tail, and make him snarl
like a tom cat on a fence in the alley.</p>

<p class='c018'>He talks about riding down a herd of elephants,
and picking out the biggest ones,
and roping them; and the way Pa is going
to scare rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and make them bleat like calves is a wonder.</p>

<p class='c018'>I think Pa is the bravest man I ever saw,
when he tells it, but I noticed when we had
that goat by the horns and he was caught
in a barbed wire fence, so the airship had to
slow down until he came loose, Pa turned
as pale as a sheet, and when the goat bucked
him in the stomach Pa’s lips moved as
though he was praying. Well, anyway,
this trip to Africa to catch wild animals is
going to show what kind of sand there is
in all of us.</p>

Pa Is Suspected of Being an Anarchist—The
Boy Finds Pa Seated at a Large
Table Bragging About America—He
Told Them the Men in America Were All

<p class='c017'>The greatest relief I ever experienced was
getting off of that cattle ship, which I did
somewhere in France, because the ship had
become so foul smelling that one had to
stay on deck to breathe, and there was no
more fun to have, cause the officers and crew
got on to me, and everyone expected to be
blown up or electrocuted if they got near
to me, and the last three days they wouldn’t
let me eat in the cabin or sleep in my hammock,
so I had to go down with the cattle
and eat hot bran mash, and sleep in the hay.
Gee, but when you eat hot bran mash for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>a few days you never want to look at breakfast
food again as long as you live.</p>

<p class='c018'>I traded my electric battery to a deck
hand for a suit case, and so I looked like
a tourist, because I went to a hotel and got
a square meal, and had a porter paste some
hotel ads. on my suit case, and I took a
train for Paris, looking for Pa, cause I
knew he wouldn’t be far away from the
bullyvards.</p>

<p class='c018'>I left my baggage at a hotel where we
stopped when we were in Paris before, and
the man who spoke shattered English told
me Pa was rooming there, but he was not
around much, because he was being entertained
by the American residents, and had
some great scheme that took him away on
secret expeditions often, and they thought
he was either an anarchist or grafter, and
since the assassination of the king and
crown prince of Portugal the police had
overhauled his baggage in his room several
times, but couldn’t find anything incriminating,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>so I had my baggage sent to Pa’s
room, and went out to find Pa, and pick up
something that would throw suspicion on
him if he showed any inclination to go back
on me when I found him.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was getting along towards dark when
I walked down a bullyvard where Pa used
to go when we were in Paris before, and
as I came to a café where there was a sign,
English spoken, I saw a crowd out on the
sidewalk surrounding tables, eating and
drinking, and there was one big table with
about a dozen men and women, Americans,
Frenchmen and other foreigners, listening
to an elderly man bragging about America,
and I saw it was Pa, but he was so
changed that but for his bald head and
chin whiskers I would not have known
him.</p>

<p class='c018'>He had on French clothes, one of those
French silk hats that had a flat brim and
a bell crown, and he had a moustache that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>was pointed at the ends and was waxed so
it would put your eyes out.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa was telling them that all the men in
America were millionaires and unmarried,
and that all of them came abroad to spend
money and marry foreign ladies, to take
them back to America and make queens of
them, and he looked at a French woman
across the table with goo-goo eyes, and she
said to the man next to her, “Isn’t he a
dear, and what a wonder he is not married
before,” and Pa smiled at her and put his
hand on his watch chain, on which there
hung gold nuggets as big as walnuts, and
he fixed a big diamond in his scarf, so the
electric light would hit it plenty.</p>

<p class='c018'>They ate and drank and the party began
to break up, when Pa and the beautiful
woman were alone at the table, and they
hunched up closer together, and Pa was talking
sweet to her, and telling her that all
wives in America had special trains on railroads,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>and palaces in New York, and at
Newport and in Florida, and yachts and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>gold mines, and she could be the queen of
them all if she would only say the word,
and she was just going to say the word, or
something, and had his fat, pudgy hand in
both of hers, and was looking into his eyes
with her own liquid eyes, and seemed ready
to fall into his arms, when I got up behind
him and lighted a giant fire cracker and put
it under his chair and just as the fuse was
sputtering, I said, “Pa, ma wants you at
the hotel,” and the fireworks went off, the
woman threw a fit and Pa raised up out of
the smoke and looked at me and said,
“Now, where in hell did you come from
just at this time?” and the head waiter took
the woman into a private room to bring
her out of her fit, the waiters opened the
windows to let the smoke out, and the
crowd stampeded, and the police came in
to pull the place and find the anarchist who
threw the bomb, and Pa took me by the
hand and we walked up the sidewalk to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>corner, and when we got out of sight of the
crowd Pa said, “Hennery, your ma ain’t here,
is she?” in a pitiful tone, and I said no she
wasn’t along with me this trip, and Pa said,
“Hennery, you make me weary,” and we
walked along to the hotel, Pa asking me so
many questions about home that it was a
like a catekism.</p>

<div id='il_17'  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Fireworks Went Off—the Woman Threw a Fit, and Pa Raised Out of the Smoke.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>When we got to the hotel and went to
Pa’s room and I told him what I had been
doing since he abandoned me, he said he
was proud of me, and now he had plenty of
work and adventure for me to keep him in.</p>

<p class='c018'>He said he had tried several airships, by
having someone else go up in them, and
that he was afraid to go up in one himself,
and he seemed glad that I had been ballooning
around home, and he said he could use
me to good advantage.</p>

<p class='c018'>I asked him about the woman he was
talking to about marriage, and he said that
was all guff, that she had a husband who
had invented a new airship, and he was trying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>to get title to it for use in America, for
war purposes, and that the only way to get
on the right side of these French women
was to talk about marriage and money, because
for money any of them would leave
their husbands on fifteen minutes’ notice.
He said he had arranged for a trial of the
airship the next day, from a place out in
the country, and that I could go up with
the inventor of the ship and see how it
worked and report, so we went to bed and
I slept better than I had since I shipped
on the cattle ship.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the morning while we were taking
baths and preparing for breakfast, I found
that Pa had been flying pretty high on government
money, and he had all kinds of
gold and paper money and bonds, and he
made people think he owned most of
America.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa asked me how the people at home
looked upon his absence, and if they advanced
any theories as to the cause of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>being abroad, and I told him that everybody
from the President down to Rockefeller
knew about what he was out looking
after, and that when I left Bob Evans at
Fortress Monroe he told me to tell Pa to
send a mess of airships to him so he would
meet them when he got to San Francisco,
as he wanted to paralyze the Japs if they
got busy around the fleet, which pleased
Pa, and he said, “Just tell the people to
wait, and I will produce airships that can
fight battles in the clouds, but it will take
time.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Then we went out in the country about
a dozen miles, and met the inventor and
his wife, and the inventor filled a big balloon
that looked like a weiner sausage with
gas that he made over a fire out in a field,
and the inventor and I got on a bamboo
frame under the balloon, and he turned on
the gasoline that runs the wheel for steering,
and they cut her loose and we went up about
fifty feet and sailed around the country a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>half mile either way and watched Pa and the
wife of the inventor as they sat under a tree
and talked politics.</p>

<p class='c018'>We came back after a while and Pa was
proud of me for having so much nerve, and
I told him the government at home was
complaining because Pa didn’t go up in the
airships, cause they said he couldn’t buy
airships intelligently unless he tried them
out, and that if he didn’t look out they
would send some expert out to take his
place and spend the money, and as we were
landed on the ground I dared Pa to get on
the frame and go up with us for a little
spin, and he was afraid the woman would
think he was a coward if he didn’t, so he
got up and straddled the ridge pole of the
bamboo frame, and said he would take a
whirl at it if it killed him. The balloon thing
couldn’t quite lift all of us, so I got off and
give her a lift, and up she went with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>the inventor steering, and Pa hanging on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>for dear life and saying, “Now I lay me down
to sleep.”</p>

<div id='il_18'  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Up She Went with the Inventor Steering, and Pa Hanging On for Dear Life.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>I have seen some scared men in my life,
but when the machine got up about as high
as a house, so Pa couldn’t get off, and the
woman waved a handkerchief at Pa, he
swallowed his Adam’s apple and said,
“Let her go Gallagher,” and Gallagher, the
Frenchman, let her go.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, you’d a died to see the thing wobble
and see Pa cling on with his feet and
hands. For about a quarter of a mile she
went queer, like a duck that has been wing-tipped,
and then she began to descend.</p>

<p class='c018'>First she passed over a lot of cows that
women were milking, and the cows stampeded
one way and the women the other
way, and the women were scared more
than the cows, cause when they got out from
under the ship they prayed, but the cows
didn’t.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then the ship struck a field where about
forty women were piling onions on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>ground, and it just scattered women and
onions all over the field, and of all the yelling
you ever heard that was the worst.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa yelled to them that if he ever got off
that hay rack alive he would pay the damages,
and he thought he was swearing at
them. Then the worst thing possible happened.
The airship went up over a tree,
and Pa was scared and he grabbed a limb
and let go of the bamboo, and there he was
in the top of a thornapple tree. The balloon
went over all right, and the inventor
steered it away to where it started from,
and the woman and I watched Pa. The
thorns were about two inches long and more
than a hundred of them got into Pa and he
yelled all kinds of murder, and then the
women who owned the cows and onions the
ship had wrecked surrounded the tree with
hoes and rakes and pitchforks, and they made
such a frantic noise that Pa did not dare
to come down out of the tree. So Pa told
us to take the train back to Paris and send
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>the American Consul and the police and a
hook and ladder company to get him down
and protect him.</p>

<p class='c018'>I told Pa I didn’t want to go off and leave
him to be killed by strange women, and
maybe eaten by wolves before morning,
but he said, “Don’t talk back to me, you go
and send that patrol wagon and the hook
and ladder truck, and be quick about it or
I won’t do a thing to you when I catch
you.”</p>

<p class='c018'>So we went and put the airship in a barn
and went back to town and turned in a police
and fire alarm to rescue Pa. The chief
said there was no use in going out there in
the country before morning, because the
women couldn’t get up the thornapple tree
and Pa couldn’t get down. So I went to bed
and dreamed about Pa all night, and had
a perfectly lovely time.</p>

<p class='c017'>Pa has had the hardest time of his life
in Paris, and if I ever pitied a man it was
Pa.<a id='tn117a'></a></p>

<p class='c018'>You see that last fly in the airship pretty
near caused him to cash in his chips and go
over the long road to the hereafter, cause he
got blood poison from the thorns that run
into him where he landed in the top limbs
of the thorn apple tree, and he sprained his
arm and one hind leg while being taken
down with a derrick, and then before we
left the country town for Paris he drank
some goat’s milk, which gave him ptomaine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>poison in his inside works, and a peasant
woman who sewed up his pants where they
were torn on the tree pricked him with a
needle, and he swelled up so he was unable
to sit in a car seat, and his face was scratched
by the thorns of the tree, and there were
blotches all over him, so when we got to
Paris the health officers thought he had
smallpox and sent him to a pest house, and
they wouldn’t let me in, but vaccinated me
and turned me loose, and I went to the hotel
and told about where Pa was and all about
it, and they put our baggage in a sort of oven
filled with sulphur and disinfected it and
stole some of it, and they made me sleep in
a dog kennel, and for weeks I had to keep
out of sight, until Pa was discharged from
the hospital, and the friends of Pa out at
the airship club in the country got Pa’s airship
that he bought for a government out of
the tree and took it to the club and presented
a bill for two hundred dollars, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>only had seven dollars, so they held it for
ransom.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gee, but I worried about Pa!</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, one day Pa showed up at the hotel
looking like he had been in a railroad wreck,
and he was so thin his clothes had to be
pinned up with safety pins, and he had spent
all his money and was bursted.</p>

<p class='c018'>The man who hired Pa in Washington to
go abroad and buy airships for the government
told Pa to use his own money for a
month or two and then draw on the secretary
of the treasury for all he needed, so before
Pa went to the hospital he drew on his
government for ten thousand dollars, and
when he came back there was a letter for
him from the American consul in Paris telling
him to call at the office, so Pa went there
and they arrested him on the charge of skull
dugging. They said he had no right to draw
for any money on the government at Washington.
Pa showed his papers with the big
seal on, and the consul laughed in Pa’s face,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>and Pa was hot under the collar and wanted
to fight, but they showed him that the papers
he had were no good, and that he had
been buncoed by some fakir in Washington,
who got five hundred dollars from Pa for securing
him a job as government agent, and
all his papers authorized him to do was to
travel at his own expense and to buy all the
airships he wanted to with his own money,
and Pa had a fit. All the money he had spent
was a dead loss, and all he had to show for
it was a punctured airship, which he was
afraid to ride in.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa swore at the government, at the consul
and at the man who buncoed him, and
they released him from arrest when he
promised that he would not pose any more
as a government agent, and we went back
to the hotel.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Well, this is a fine scrape you have got
me in,” says Pa, as we went to our room.
“What in thunder did I have to do about
it?” says I, just like that. “I wasn’t with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>you when you framed up this job and let a
man in Washington skin you out of your
money by giving you a soft snap which has
exploded in your hands. Gee, Pa, what you
need is a maid or a valet or something that
will hold on to your wad.” Pa said he didn’t
need anybody to act as a guardian to him,
cause he had all the money he needed in his
letter of credit to the American Express
Company in Paris, and he knew how to
spend his money freely, but he did hate to
be buncoed and made the laughing stock of
two continents.</p>

<p class='c018'>So Pa and I went down to the express office,
and Pa gave the man in charge a paper,
and the grand hailing sign of distress, and
he handed out bags of gold and bales of bills,
and Pa hid a lot in his leather belt and put
some in his pockets, and said: “Come on,
Henry, and we will see this town and buy it
if we like it.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, we went out after dark and took in
the concert halls and things, and Pa drank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>wine and I drank nothing but ginger ale, and
women who waited on us sat in Pa’s lap and
patted his bald head and tried to feel in his
pockets, but Pa held on to their wrists and
told them to keep away, and he took one
across his knee and slapped her across the
pajamas with a silver tray, and I thought Pa
was real saucy.</p>

<p class='c018'>A head waiter whispered to me and
wanted to know what ailed the old sport,
and I told him Pa was bitten by a wolf in
our circus last year and we feared he was
going to have hydrophobia, and always when
these spells come on the only thing to do
was to throw him into a tank of water, and
I should be obliged to them if they would
take Pa and duck him in the fountain in the
center of the cafe and save his life.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa was making up with the girl he had
paddled with the silver tray, buying champagne
for her and drinking some of it himself
out of her slipper, when the head waiter
called half a dozen Frenchmen who were doing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>police duty and told them to duck Pa
in the fountain, and they grabbed him by
the collar and the pants and made him walk
turkey towards the fountain, and he held on
to the girl, and the Frenchmen threw Pa and
the girl into the brink with a flock of ducks,
and they went under water, and Pa came up
first yelling murder, and then the girl came
up hanging to Pa’s neck, and she gave a
French yell of agony, and Pa gave the grand
hailing sign of distress and yelled to know
if there was not an American present that
would protect an American citizen from the
hands of a Paris mob. The crowd gathered
around the circular fountain basin, and one
drunken fellow jumped in the water and was
going to hold Pa’s head under water while
the girl found his money, when Pa yelled
“Hey, Rube,” the way they do in a circus
when there is a fight, and by ginger it wasn’t
a second before half a dozen old circus men
that used to belong to the circus when Pa
was manager in the States made a rush for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>the fountain, knocked the Frenchmen gally
west and pulled Pa out of the water and let
him drain off, and they said, “Hello, old
man, how did you happen to let them drown
you?” and Pa saw who the boys were and
he hugged them and invited them to all take
something and then go to his hotel.</p>

<p class='c018'>When Pa paid the check for the drinks
they charged in two ducks they said Pa
killed in the tank by falling on them. But
Pa paid it and was so tickled to meet the
old circus boys that he gave the girl he went
in swimming with a twenty franc note, and
after staying until along towards morning
we all got into and on top of a hack and
went to the hotel and sat up till daylight
talking things over.</p>

<p class='c018'>We found the Circus boys were on the
way to Germany to go with the Hagenbach
outfit to South Africa to capture Wild Animals
for circuses, and when Pa told the boss,
who was one of Hagenbach’s managers,
about his airship and what a dandy thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>it would be to sail around where the lions
and tigers live in the Jungle, and lasso them
from up in the air, out of danger, he engaged
Pa and me to go along, and I guess we will
know all about Africa pretty soon.</p>

<p class='c018'>The next day we went out to the club
where Pa keeps his airship, with the boss
of Hagenbach’s outfit and a cowboy that
used to be with Pa’s circus, to practice
lassoing things. They got out the machine
and Pa steered it, and the boss and I were
passengers, and the cowboy was on the railing
in front with his lariat rope, and we
sailed along about fifty feet high over the
farms, until we saw a big goat. The cowboy
motioned for Pa to steer towards the
goat, and when we got near enough the
cowboy threw the rope over the goat’s horns
and tightened it up, and Mr. Goat came right
along with us, bleating and fighting. We
led the goat about half a mile over some
fences, and finally came down to the ground
to examine our catch, and we landed all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>right, and Hagenbach’s boss said it was the
greatest scheme that ever was for catching
wild animals, and he doubled Pa’s salary
and said we would pack up the next day and
go to the Hagenbach farm in Germany and
take a steamer for South Africa in a week.</p>

<p class='c018'>They were talking it over and the cowboy
had released the goat, when that animal
made a charge with his head on our party.
He struck Pa below the belt, butted the boss
in the trousers until he laid down and begged
for mercy, stabbed the cowboy with his
horns and then made a hop, skip and jump
for the gas bag, burst a hole in it, and when
the gas began to escape the goat’s horns got
caught in the gas bag and the goat died from
the effects of the gas, and we were all glad
until about fifty peasant women came across
the fields with agricultural implements and
were going to kill us all.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa said, “Well, what do you know about
that,” but the women were fierce and wanted
our blood. The boss could talk French, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>he offered to give them the goat to settle it,
but they said it was their goat any way, and
they wanted blood or damages.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa said it was easier to give damages than
blood, and just as they were going to cut up
the gas bag the boss settled with them for
about twenty dollars, and hired them to haul
the airship to the nearest station, and we
shipped it to Berlin and got ready to follow
the next day.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa says we will have a high old time in
Africa. He says he wants to ride up to a
lion’s den in his airship and dare the fiercest
lion to come out and fight, and that he
wouldn’t like any better fun than to ride
over a royal bengal tiger in the jungle and
reach down and grab his tail and make him
synawl like a tom cat on a fence in the alley.</p>

<p class='c018'>He talks about riding down a herd of elephants
and picking out the biggest ones and
roping them; and the way Pa is going to
scare rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses and
make them bleat like calves is a wonder.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>I think Pa is the bravest man I ever saw,
when he tells it, but I noticed when we had
that goat by the horns and he was caught in
a barbed wire fence, so the airship had to
slow down until he came loose, Pa turned
as pale as a sheet, and when the goat bucked
him in the stomach Pa’s lips moved as
though in praying. Well, anyway, this
trip to Africa to catch wild animals is going
to show what kind of sand there is in all
of us.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Boy and His Pa Leave France and Go
to Germany, Where They Buy an Airship—They
Get the Airship Safely Landed—Pa
and the Boy With the Airship Start
for South Africa—Pa Shows the Men
What Power He Has Over the Animal
Kingdom.</p>

<p class='c017'>I was awful glad to get out of France
and into Germany, and when we had got
the airship safely landed at the Hagenbach
stock farm and boxed and baled ready to
load on a boat for South Africa, and all
hands had drank a few schooners of beer,
and felt brave enough to tackle any wild animal
that walks the earth, I listened to the
big talk and the gestures, though I couldn’t
understand a word they said, except when
they held up their fingers for more beer.</p>

<p class='c018'>I felt that we had got among Americans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>again, because all a German needs to be an
American is to be able to talk a little
broken English. The French are all right
in their way, but they are too polite. If a
Frenchman wants to order you out of his
place he is so polite about it that you think
he wants you to stay there always and be
at home.</p>

<p class='c018'>If a German wants you to get out he
says “Rouse” in a hoarse voice, and if you
don’t rouse he gives you a swift kick in the
pants and you instinctively catch on to the
fact that you are due some other place.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Germans that are with us on the
animal hunt in South Africa all speak
English, and while at the Hagenbach farm
Pa convinced everybody that he was the
bravest animal man in the world, “cause he
would go up to any cage where the animals
had been tamed and act as free with them
as though he did not know fear,” and he
went around in his shirt sleeves the way he
used to in the circus, and would pat a lion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>on the head, and if the animal growled Pa
would scowl at him and make the lion believe
Pa was king of beasts.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa has found that putting on a pair of
automobile goggles and getting down on
his hands and knees and crawling towards
the animal in captivity frightens the animal
into a fit, but I guess when he tries that
stunt on wild animals on the veldt of Africa
he will find it does not work so well.</p>

<p class='c018'>I expect to have to bring Pa back the
way they transport canned sausage, after a
few wild lions and tigers and hippopotamuses
have used him for a cud to chew
on.</p>

<p class='c018'>Before we took the steamer for South
Africa I had the first serious talk with Pa
that I have had since I joined him in Paris.
I said, “Pa, don’t you think this idea of
chasing wild animals in Africa with an airship
is going to be a sort of a dangerous
proposition?” and Pa began to look brave,
and he said, “Hennery, this is an age of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>progress, and we have to get out of the rut,
and catch up with the procession and lead
it. The old way of capturing wild animals
by enticing them into baited traps and letting
them touch a spring and imprison
themselves is about as dangerous as catching
mice in a wire trap with a piece of
cheese for bait.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Of course, we shall take along all of the
traps and things usually used for that purpose,
because roping animals from an airship
is only an experiment, and we want to
be on the safe side, but if the airship proves
a success I will be considered the pioneer
in airship wild animal capturing, and all
animal men will bow down to your Pa, see,
and my fortune will be made. We will get
into the animal country and locate a few
lions and tigers, first, and sail over their
lairs in the jungle, and while I hold the
steering apparatus our cowboys will sit on
the bamboo rails of the ship and throw the
rope over their necks, and when they find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>we have got them where the hair is short
they will lie down and bleat like a calf, and
when we dismount and go up to them to tie
their legs they will be so tame they will
eat out of your hand.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I have got it all figured out in my mind
and I don’t want you or anybody else to
butt in with any discouraging talk, for I
won’t have it.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“But suppose the airship gets caught in
a tree?” I said to Pa. “Well, then, we will
tie up and catch baboons,” said Pa. “Everything
goes with your Pa, Hennery.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, it was like moving a circus to get
the stuff loaded for South Africa, as we had
more than fifty cages to put animals in to
bring home, and tents and food enough for
an arctic expedition, and over two hundred
men, and several tame lionesses and female
tigers to use for decoys, and some elephants
for Judases to rope in the wild animals,
and when we got started it was more
than a week before we struck the coast of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Africa, and all there was to do on the trip
was to play poker and practice on the tame
animals.</p>

<p class='c018'>We almost lost a tame lioness. Pa
wanted to show the men what power he
had over the animal kingdom and he induced
the manager to turn Carrie Nation,
the big lioness, loose on deck, while Pa put
on his auto goggles and scared her. Gee,
but I thought I was an orphan for sure.
The boys had trained that lioness to be a
retriever, like a water spaniel, and on every
trip some of the boys would jump overboard
when there was no sea on and let
Carrie jump over the rail and rescue them,
so when they let her out she thought there
was going to be a chance for her to get her
regular salt water bath, and that it was expected
that she would do her stunt at rescuing
a human being.</p>

<p class='c018'>When she was let out of her cage and
the crowd was lined up all around the rail,
and she saw Pa in the middle of the deck,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>on all fours, with the black goggles on, she
looked around at the crowd of her friends
as much as to say, “What is the joke?” but
she sidled up to Pa and lashed her tail
around and began to play with Pa as a kitten
would play with a ball of yarn.</p>

<p class='c018'>She put her paw on Pa and rolled him
over, and when Pa got right side up and
crawled towards her looking fierce, she
side stepped and cuffed him on the jaw and
everybody laughed except Pa.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then Pa thought he would make a
grandstand play and drive her back in her
cage, and he started towards her real fast
on his hands and knees, and gave a “honk-honk”
like an auto, and we thought she was
scared, but I guess she wasn’t frightened
so you would notice it, for she jumped sideways
and got around behind Pa, and I
said, “Sick him, Carrie,” and by gosh she
grabbed Pa by the slack of his pants and
made a rush for the railing, and before I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>could grab her by the tail she jumped right
overboard with Pa in her mouth, and landed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>kersplash in the deep blue sea, with Pa
yelling to the men to take her off.</p>

<div id='il_19'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/airship_pic19.png'><img src='images/airship_pic19.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Pa Gave a “Honk, Honk” Like an Auto, But the Lion Wasn’t Frightened So You Would Notice.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>We all rushed to the rail, and I began
to cry, but the boys told me not to be scared,
as Carrie would bring Pa to the yawl all
right.</p>

<p class='c018'>The men launched a life boat and the
lioness was swimming around with Pa in
her teeth, as though she was a dog with a
rag doll in its mouth.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa was swallowing salt water and saying
something that sounded like “Now I
lay me,” and Carrie was trying to keep his
head out of the water by lifting hard on his
pants, and finally the life boat got near
them and they grabbed Pa by the legs and
pulled him in and he laid down in the bottom
of the boat, and the lioness climbed
over the side and began to shake herself,
and then she licked the salt water off, and
when the boat came alongside she jumped
up on the deck and rolled over and turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>somersaults, and then they pulled Pa on
deck and when he got his sea legs on he
said to the manager of the expedition and
the captain of the boat, “Gentlemen, I have
rescued your lion, and I claim salvage, and
you can give me credit for whatever she is
worth as a show animal,” and then Carrie
went to her cage, and everybody patted Pa
on the back and made him think he had
saved a thousand-dollar lion from drowning.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa asked me to accompany him to our
stateroom, and when the door was closed
and he saw my tear-stained face, he said,
“You think you are dam smart, don’t you?
I heard you say sick him to that old moth-eaten
lion, and now don’t you ever interfere
with my plans again. I got that lion
so frightened by my fierce look, and the
noise I made, that she jumped overboard,
and I went along to save her. Now, help
me off with my clothes and rub me down,
and I will go out and chase a tiger round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>the deck, and make it climb up into the
rigging and beg to be taken down. That
is the kind of a man your Pa is,” and Pa
began to shuck himself, and I rubbed him
down as if he was a race horse. I can see
that when we come to the wild animal fields
Pa is going to astonish the natives.</p>

<p class='c018'>We landed at a port in South Africa in
the night, and before morning we had all
our stuff on a special train and about daylight
we pulled out for a place about three
hundred miles from the coast, and the next
day we were in camp with the tents all up
and the cages in place, and had engaged
two hundred negroes with no clothes on to
help us.</p>

<p class='c018'>When they saw the airship spread out
ready to be filled with gas when we got
ready to use it, some of them deserted, but
we got others to take their places.</p>

<p class='c018'>I suppose when we fill that gas bag with
chemical gas and it begins to flop around,
there won’t be a negro left in Africa.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>We were in wild animal country all right.
The first night the lions in the jungle kept
us awake, and Carrie Nation answered
every time the wild lions bellowed, until
Pa had to go and maul her with a bamboo
club.</p>

<p class='c018'>The next morning there were lion tracks
all around camp, and Pa says the trouble is
going to be that the lions will hunt us instead
of our having to go after them.</p>

<p class='c018'>A drove of zebras stampeded by our camp
the first morning, a couple of giraffes were
looking us over from a hill top, and a rhinoceros
went through the camp and stole a
smoked ham.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa is so scared he stays in his tent most
of the time and shivers. He says he has
got chills and fever, but I can tell when a
man’s heart comes up in his mouth, and
chokes him.</p>

<p class='c018'>I told him this morning that if he showed
the white feather now it was all off with
him, and the Hagenbach’s would leave him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>in Africa to be adopted by a tribe. Pa said,
“You watch me when we get to catching animals.
I will make any animal that crosses
my path think he has run into a live wire.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, I hope Pa will not be a coward.</p>

<p class='c016'>All Kinds of Climates in South Africa—Pa
Hires Men to Capture Wild Animals—The
Boy and His Pa Capture Some
Tigers and a Big Lion—They Have a
Narrow Escape from a Rhinoceros.</p>

<p class='c017'>I don’t know whether I like the climate
of South Africa or not, but you can have
any kind of climate you are looking for,
from the Alaska kind to the tropical kind,
the same day.</p>

<p class='c018'>I think it is the climate that makes all the
animals so mad. One minute a lion or a
tiger may be lolling with his tongue out,
fighting flies and scratching fleas, and the
next minute there are icicles on his moustache,
and he has to crawl into a hole in the
ground to keep from freezing.</p>

<p class='c018'>These natives beat me. They do not wear
any clothes except a doily, made of bark or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>grass, over their loins, and from the doily,
above and below, their skin is bare, and they
ought to be arrested for disorderly conduct
and exposure, but their skin is thick and
warty like a rhinoceros, and when it freezes
it looks like pickled pigs’ feet.</p>

<p class='c018'>One man we have hired to help capture
animals is a native chief with sixty wives,
and he has brought them all to camp with
him, and we have to feed them, and it is
rumored the women all have their caps set
for Pa, if the husband dies, and Pa is afraid
they will kill their old man and select Pa to
fill the vacancy, that being the unwritten
law that a man’s wives can select a husband.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gee, if I had to be a stepson to all those
sixty senegambians that look like monkeys
in the face and when on dress parade like
oxen, I should die, or they would, if I could
find chloroform enough to go around.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, Pa is trying his best to save the
life of that husband of the sixty wives, and
every time one of the wives pats Pa on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>back or chucks him under the chin he has
a chill, and I know he will do something
desperate if they get after him in flocks.</p>

<p class='c018'>I suppose I ought not to have done it, but
I told one of the wives who understands a
little English that Pa liked to be hugged
and squeezed, and held on the girls’ laps, so
when we get through work at night and sit
around the camp fire they take turns holding
Pa on their laps, and he thinks one of
the women broke one of his ribs hugging
him, cause they are strong as giants, and
have a terrible squeeze.</p>

<p class='c018'>I told one of them she could make herself
solid with Pa if she could get him a nice
long snake, so she went off into the jungle
alone and came back dragging a snake more
than twenty feet long, and put it in Pa’s
tent when he was asleep. When Pa woke
up in the morning and found the snake
coiled upon his blanket he threw a fit and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>went to the doctor and got some medicine
for chills and fever, and we put the snake
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>into a cage to sell to a menagerie.</p>

<div id='il_20'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/airship_pic20.png'><img src='images/airship_pic20.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>When Pa Found the Snake Coiled Up on His Blanket He Threw a Fit.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The old airship got in its work the first
time we tried it, though we didn’t make gas
enough to more than half fill it, and it
wouldn’t fly, but we got some tigers and
a big lion, all right.</p>

<p class='c018'>We took the airship out on an open
prairie and built a fire to make the gas for
the balloon, and Pa made everybody stay
away from it except me, and when we got it
inflated we were to blow a horn, and the
people we wanted to go along could come,
but the crowd of workers and negroes must
stay back, so as not to scare the animals,
and be ready to bring cages up when we
blew the horn three consecutive times.</p>

<p class='c018'>We were not looking around much, but
just paying attention to our gas, and steering
it into the gas bag, and we had got the
bag about half full, and it was lying on the
grass like a big whale that has died at sea
and floated ashore, and we were busy thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>of how we would sail over the veldt and
have our cowboy rope a few lions and
choke them into submission, when I happened
to look around towards the jungle,
and there were two tigers crawling through
the grass towards the gas bag, and a lion
walking right towards it as though he was
saying to the tigers, “Ah, g’wan, I saw it
first,” and a rhinoceros was rooting along
like a big hog, right towards us. I told Pa
to look out, and when he saw the animals
he seemed to lose all appetite for lions and
tigers in their wild state, for he started for
a tree and told me to climb up, too. Well,
it took Pa quite a while to get up on a limb,
but he finally got all his person up there,
and I was right with him, and Pa looked at
the animals creeping up to the gas bag, and
he said, “Bub, the success of this expedition
will be settled right here if that lion drinks
any of the gasoline.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, I have seen cats crawling along the
floor towards a mouse hole, and stopping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>and looking innocent when the mouse stuck
his head out of the hole, and then moving
on again when the mouse disappeared, and
these tigers acted that way, stopping every
time the wind caused the gas bag to flap on
the ground. The lion acted like a big St.
Bernard dog that smells something ahead
that he don’t exactly know what to make
of, but is going to find out, and the rhinoceros
just rooted along as though he was getting
what he wanted out of the ground, and
would be along after a while to investigate
that thing that was rising like a big ant
hill on the prairie and smelling like a natural
gas well. Finally the tigers got near
enough to the gas bag with their claws, running
their noses down into the holes where
the gas was escaping, and fairly drinking
in the gas. Their weight sent the bag down
to the ground, and they were in the middle,
inhaling gas, and pretty soon the lion came
up and clawed a hole in the gas bag and
acted as though he was not going to let the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>tigers have all the good stuff and pretty soon
we could see from up the tree that they
were being overcome by the fumes, and
Pa said in about four minutes we would have
a mess of animals chloroformed good and
plenty, and we would go down and hobble
them and hog-tie them like they do cattle
on the ranches. What bothered us about
going down the tree was the rhinoceros
that was coming rooting along, but after a
while he came up and smelled of the gasoline
can, tipped it over, and as the gasoline
trickled out on the ground he laid down
and rolled in it like a big pig, and after he
had got well soaked in gasoline he rolled
near the fire, and in a minute he was all
ablaze and about the scaredest rhinoceros
that ever roamed the prairie.</p>

<p class='c018'>When the fire began to scorch his hide
he let out a bellow that could be heard a
mile and started towards the camp on a
gallop, looking like a barn afire, and Pa said
now was the time to capture our sleeping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>animals, so we shinned down the tree and
found the lion dead to the world, and we
tied his feet together and put a bag over his
head, and then climbed over the gas bag
and found the two tigers sleeping as sweetly
as babes, and I held their legs together
while Pa tied all four legs so tight they
couldn’t move a muscle, and then Pa told
me to blow the horn for the cages to be sent
out.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gee, but I was proud of that morning’s
work, two tigers and a lion with no more
danger than shooting cats on a back fence
with a bean snapper, and Pa and I shook
hands and patted each other on the back.
I told Pa he was a wonder, and that Mr.
Hagenbach would probably make him a
general in the Prussian army, but Pa looked
modest and said, “All it needs is brain and
sand to overcome the terrors of the jungle,”
and just then we saw the cages coming
across the veldt, and Pa said, “Now, when
the boys come up with the cages you put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>one foot on the lion and strike an attitude
like a lion tamer, and I will play with the
tigers.”</p>

<p class='c018'>When the cages came up I was on to my
job all right, and the boys gave me three
cheers, and they asked where Pa was, and
I pointed to the center of the gas bag and
said Pa was in there having a little fun with
a mess of tigers, and when they walked over
the billowy gas bag they found Pa with one
of the tigers that had partly come to playing
with him and chewing his pants, but
they rescued Pa and in a few minutes they
had our three animals in the cages, and we
started for camp, Pa walking behind the
cages with his coat over his arm, telling
young Hagenbach the confoundedest story
about how he subdued the animals by just
hypnotizing them, and I never said a word.
A boy that will not stand up for his father
is an idgit.</p>

<p class='c018'>When we got to camp the natives had all
scattered to the four winds. It seemed that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>when the fiery rhinoceros came towards
them they thought the Great Spirit had sent
fire to destroy them, and they took to the
jungle, the rhino after them, bellowing all
kinds of cheering messages from the Great
Spirit.</p>

<p class='c018'>Along towards night they came to camp
dragging a cooked rhinoceros, and they
turned in to eat it, and all those sixty females
brought nice pieces of rhino, cooked by gasoline,
to Pa, and wanted Pa to eat it, but
Pa said he was dieting, and it was Friday,
anyway, and he never ate meat on Friday.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then we all sat up all night, and everybody
made speeches glorifying Pa as the
greatest hero that ever came to Africa, and
that he had Stanley beaten a mile, and Pa
blushed, and the women held him in their
laps and said he was the dearest thing ever.</p>

<p class='c016'>Pa Was a Hero After Capturing Two Tigers
and a Lion—Pa Had an Old Negro With
Sixty Wives Working for Him—Pa
Makes His Escape in Safety—Pa Goes to
Catch Hippopotamusses.</p>

<p class='c017'>Pa was a hero after capturing the two
tigers and the lion after they had inhaled
gas from the gas bag of the air ship, because
the crowd didn’t know how it was
done. Everybody thought Pa had scared
the wild animals with the airship until they
were silly, and then hypnotized them, and
got them into cages, but when the animals
came out from under the influence of the
gas and began to raise the roof, and bite and
snarl, the whole camp was half scared to
death, and they all insisted on Pa going to
the cages and quieting them by his hypnotic
eye, but Pa was too wise to try it on wild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>animals, and he had to confess that it was
the gas bag that did the work, and they
made Pa fix up a gas bag under the cages
and quiet the animals, and when the employees
of the expedition found that Pa was
not so much of a hero as he pretended, Pa
was not so much of a king as he had been,
except in the minds of the African negroes
who were at work for us. That old negro
who had sixty wives fairly doted on Pa, and
the wives thought Pa was the greatest man
that ever was, and the wives fairly got struck
on Pa, and wanted to take turns holding Pa
in their laps, until the giant husband of the
sixty big black females got jealous of Pa,
and wanted to hit him on the head with a
war club, but Pa showed him a thing or two
that made him stand without hitching.</p>

<p class='c018'>The black husband had a tooth ache, and
asked Pa to cure him of the pain, and Pa
had him lie down on the ground, and he put
some chloroform on a handkerchief and held
it to the man’s nose, and pretty soon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>negro was dead to the world, and the wives
thought Pa had killed their husband with
his mighty power, and they insisted that
Pa marry the whole sixty wives. Pa kicked
on it, but Mr. Hagenbach told Pa that was
the law in that part of Africa, and that he
would have to marry them.</p>

<p class='c018'>I never saw Pa so discouraged as he was
when the oldest wife took his hand and said
some words in the negro dialect, and pronounced
Pa married to the whole bunch,
and when they led Pa to the man’s tent,
followed by all the wives, half of them singing
a dirge for the dead husband, and the
other half singing a wedding hymn, and
Pa looking around scared, and trying to get
away from his new family, it was pathetic,
but all the hands connected with the Hagenbach
expedition laughed, and Pa disappeared
in the tent of his wives, and they
hustled around to prepare a banquet of
roasted zebra, and boiled rhinoceros.</p>

<p class='c018'>We went to the tent and looked in, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Pa was the picture of despair, seated in the
middle of the tent, all the female negroes
petting him, and hugging him, and dressing
him in the African costume.</p>

<p class='c018'>They brought out loin clothes that belonged
to the chloroformed husband and
made Pa put them on; they blacked his
arms and legs and body with some poke
berry juice, so he looked like a negro, and
greased his body and tied some negro hair
on his head over his bald spot, and by gosh,
when I saw Pa transformed into a negro I
looked at myself in a mirror to see if I had
turned to a negro. I held the mirror up to
Pa so he could see himself, and when he
got a good look at the features that had
always been his pride, he shed a few tears
and said, “Booker Washington, by Gosh,”
and when the wives were preparing to bring
in the banquet Pa said to me, “Hennery, let
this be a lesson to you. Don’t ever try to
be smart, and don’t be a masher under any
circumstances, cause you see what it has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>brought me to. When you get back to
America tell Roosevelt that I died for my
country.” Well, they brought in the wedding
feast, and all the wives helped me and
Pa and Mr. Hagenbach, and the cow boy
that throws the lasso, and the foreman, and
we ate hearty, and all was going smooth
when there was a commotion at the door of
the tent, and in came the former husband,
who had come out from under the influence
of the chloroform, and he was crazy and had
a club.</p>

<p class='c018'>He had been told of his death, and the
marriage of his wives to the old man who
owned the gas bag, and he wouldn’t have it
that way.</p>

<p class='c018'>He knocked some of his wives down, and
some fainted away, and then he started for
the man who had usurped him in the affections
of his sixty wives.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa was scared and started to crawl under
the tent and escape into the jungle, when I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>saw that something had to be done, so I got
right in front of the crazy husband and, looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>him square in the face, I began to chant,
“Ene-mene-miny-mo, catch a nigger by
the toe,” and before I got to the end of the
first verse, the great giant said, “May be
you are right,” and he fell to the earth in
a fit probably from the effects of the chloroform,
but everybody thought I had overcome
him by my remarks, and then they
jumped on the husband and held him down
while Pa escaped, and for Pa’s safety they
put him in a cage next to the newly acquired
tigers and lions, who were cross and ugly,
but Pa said he had rather chance it with
them than with that crazy husband who had
accused him of alienating the affections of
his sixty wives.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Looking Him Square in the Face, I Began to Chant, “Ene-Mene-Miny-Mo.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The next day everything was fixed up
with the husband of the sixty wives, his
tooth ache was cured, and he quit being
mad at Pa, and we all went to a river about
a mile from camp to catch a mess of hippopotamuses.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>The usual way to catch the hippos is to
let negroes go out in boats and give the
hippos a chance to swim under the boats
and tip them over, and after they had eaten
a few negroes they would come ashore and
lie down in the mud for a nap, and they
could be tied to a wagon and hauled to the
cages.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa was to superintend the boat excursion,
because the hippos would not eat a
white man. Pa forgot that he was made
up like a negro, and so he went in the first
boat, with six negroes who had been purchased
at five dollars apiece for hippo bait.</p>

<p class='c018'>When the boat got out in the middle of
stream, and the hippo heads began to pop
up out of the water, with a “look who’s
here” expression on their open faces, Pa
turned pale, which probably saved him, for
when the boat was upset, and the hippos
took their pick of the negroes, and the water
washed the poke berry juice off Pa he was
as white as a drioenenoro, and when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>nearest hippo got his negro in his mouth and
started for the shore Pa climbed on his back
and rode ashore in triumph, grabbing the
husband of the sixty wives by the arm and
pulling him on board the hippo, and saving
his life, and right there in the mud, while
the hippos were eating their breakfasts of
cheap negroes, that husband told Pa he felt
so under obligation to him that he could
have his sixty wives in welcome, and he
would go out in the jungle and corral another
family.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa said he was much obliged but he must
decline, as in his own country no man was
allowed to have more than fifteen or twenty
wives. But the terrible scandal Pa had
brought upon the expedition was settled out
of court, and Pa was reinstated in good
standing in our expedition.</p>

<p class='c018'>It takes a hippo quite a while to go to
sleep after eating a negro, as you can imagine,
they are so indigestible, and it was
annoying to stand around in the mud and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>wait, but we finally got two specimens of
the hippo into the cages, and we killed two
more for food for the negroes, who like the
flavor of hippo meat, after the hippos have
been battered on negroes.</p>

<p class='c018'>On the way back to camp we sighted a
herd of elephants, and Pa said he would go
out and surround a couple of them and drive
them into camp. Mr. Hagenbach tried to
reason with Pa against the suicidal act, in
going alone into a herd of wild elephants,
but Pa said since his experience with old
Bolivar, the circus elephant, he felt that he
had a mysterious power over elephants that
was marvelous, and so poor Pa went out
alone, promising to bring some elephants
into camp.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, he made good, all right. We went
on to camp and got our hippos put to bed,
and fed the lions and tigers, and were just
sitting down to our evening meal, when
there was a roaring sound off where Pa had
surrounded the elephants; the air was full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>of dust, and the ground trembled, and we
could see the whole herd of about forty wild
elephants charging on our camp, bellowing
and making a regular bedlam.</p>

<p class='c018'>When the herd got pretty near us, we all
climbed trees, except the negro husband and
his wives, and they took to the jungle.</p>

<p class='c018'>Say, those animals did not do a thing to
our camp. They rushed over the tents, laid
down and rolled over on our supper, which
was spread out on the ground, tipped over
the cages containing the animals we had
captured, found the gasoline barrel and
filled their trunks with gasoline and squirted
it all over the place, and rolled the gasoline
on the fire, and away the elephants went
with gasoline fire pouring out of their
trunks, into the woods, bellowing, and when
the dust and smoke cleared away, and we
climbed down out of the trees and righted
up the cages, here came Pa astride a zebra,
playing on a mouth organ, “There’ll Be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight,”
which had frightened the elephants into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>stampede.</p>

<p>Pa, Astride of a Zebra, Had Frightened the Elephants Into a Stampede by Playing “A Hot Time” on a Mouth Organ.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Mr. Hagenbach stopped Pa’s zebra, and
Pa said, “Didn’t you catch any of ’em? I
steered ’em right to camp, and thought you
fellows would head ’em off, and catch a
few.”</p>

<p class='c018'>I never saw Mr. Hagenbach mad before.
He looked at Pa as though he could eat him
alive, and said, “Well, old man, you have
raised hell on your watch, sure enough.”
And then Pa complained because supper
was not ready. Gee, but Pa is getting more
gall all the time.</p>

<p class='c016'>Pa Was Blackmailed and Scared Out of
Lots of Money—Pa Teaching the Natives
to Speak English—Pa Said the Natives
Acted Like Human Beings—Pa Buys
Some Animals in the Jungle.</p>

<p class='c017'>We thought when we came to Africa we
would be near to nature, where the natives
were simple and honest, but Pa has found
that the almost naked negroes can give
white men cards and spades and little casino
and then beat them at the game.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa has been blackmailed and scared out
of his boots and a lot of money, by an injured
husband, as natural as he could have
been flimflammed in New York.</p>

<p class='c018'>We noticed that Pa was quite interested
in a likely negro woman, one of twenty
wives of a heathen, to the extent of having
her wash his shirts, and he would linger at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the tent of the husband and teach the woman
some words of English, such as, “You bet
your life” and “Not on your life,” and a few
cuss words, which she seemed to enjoy repeating.</p>

<p class='c018'>She was a real nice looking nigger, and
smiled on Pa to beat the band, but that was
all; of course she enjoyed having Pa call
on her, and evidently showed her interest
in him, but that seemed only natural, as
Pa is a nice, clean white man with clothes
on and she looked upon him as a sort of
king, until the other wives became jealous,
and they filled the husband up with stories
about Pa and the young negress, but Pa was
as innocent as could be. Where Pa made
the mistake was in taking hold of her hand
and looking at the lines in her palm, to read
her future by the lines in her hand, and as
Pa is some near sighted he had to bend over
her hand, and then she stroked Pa’s bald
head with the other hand, and the other
wives went off and left Pa and the young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>wife alone, and they called the husband to
put a stop to it.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well I never saw a giant negro so mad as
that husband was when he came into the
tent and saw Pa, and Pa was scared and
turned pale, and the woman had a fit when
she saw her husband with a base ball club
with spikes on it. He took his wife by the
neck and threw her out of the tent, and then
closed the tent and he and Pa were alone,
and for an hour no one knew what happened,
but when Pa came back to our camp,
wobbly in the legs, and with no clothes on
except a pair of drawers, we knew the worst
had happened.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa told Mr. Hagenbach that the negro
acted like a human being. He cried and told
Pa he had broken into his family circle and
picked the fairest flower, broken his heart
and left him an irresponsible and broken
man, the laughing stock of his friends, and
nothing but his life or his money could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>settle it.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Pa offered to give up his life, but the injured
husband had rather have the money,
and after an hour Pa compromised by giving
him sixteen dollars and his coat, pants
and shirt, and Pa is to have the wife in the
bargain. Pa didn’t want to take the wife,
but the husband insisted on it, and Mr.
Hagenbach says we can take her to America
and put her into the show as an untamed
Zulu, or a missing link, but he insists that
Pa shall be careful hereafter, with his fatal
beauty and winning ways, or we shall have
more negro women to bring back than animals
in cages.</p>

<p class='c018'>Talk about your innocent negroes, they
will cheat you out of your boots.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa went off in the jungle to buy some
animals of a negro king or some kind of a
nine spot, and he found the king had in a
corral half a dozen green zebras, the usual
yellow stripes being the most beautiful
green you ever saw. The king told Pa it
was a rare species, only procured in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>mountain fastness hundreds of miles away,
and Pa bought the whole bunch at a fabulous
price, and brought them to camp. Mr.
Hagenbach was tickled to death at the rare
animals, and praised Pa, and said there was
a fortune in the green and black striped
zebras. I thought there was something
wrong when I heard one of those zebras
bray like a mule when he was eating hay,
but it wasn’t my put in, and I didn’t say
anything.</p>

<p class='c018'>That night there was the greatest rain we
have had since we came here, and in the
morning the green and black striped zebras
hadn’t a stripe on them, and they proved to
be nothing but wild asses and assessess,
white and dirty, and all around the corral
the water standing on the ground was colored
green and black.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mr. Hagenbach took Pa out to the corral
and pointed to the wild white mules and
said, “What do you think of your green
zebras now?” Pa looked them over and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>said, “Say, that negro king is nothing but a
Pullman porter, and he painted those mules
and sawed them onto me,” so we had to
kill Pa’s green zebras and feed them to the
negroes and the animals. Mr. Hagenbach
told Pa plainly that he couldn’t stand for
such conduct. He said he was willing to
give Pa carte blanche, whatever that is, in
his love affairs in South Africa, but he drew
the line at being bunkoed on painted animals.
He believed in encouraging art, and
all that, but animals that wouldn’t wash
were not up to the Hagenbach standard.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa went off and sulked all day, but he
made good the next day.</p>

<p class='c018'>Our intention was to let elephants alone
until we were about to return home, as they
are so plenty we can find them any day, and
after you have once captured your elephants
you have got to cut hay to feed them, but
Pa gets some particular animal bug in his
head, and the managements has to let him
have his way, so the other day was his elephant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>day, and he started off through the
jungle with only a few men, and the negro
wife that he hornswoggled the husband out
of. Pa said he was going to use her for a
pointer to point elephants, the same as they
use dogs to point chickens, and when we got
about a mile into the jungle he told her to
“Hie on,” and find an elephant. Well, sir,
she has got the best elephant nose I ever
saw on a woman. She ranged ahead and
beat the ground thoroughly, and pretty soon
she began to sniff and sneak up on the game,
and all of a sudden she came to a point and
held up one foot, and her eyes stuck out, and
Pa said the game was near, and he told her
to “charge down,” and we went on to surround
the elephant. Pa was ahead and he
saw a baby elephant not bigger than a Shetland
pony, looking scared, and Pa made a
lunge and fell on top of the little elephant,
which began to make a noise like a baby
that wants a bottle of milk, and we captured
the little thing and started for camp with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>it, but before we got in sight of camp all
the elephants in Africa were after us, crashing
through the timber and trumpeting like
a menagerie.</p>

<div id='il_24'  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Pa Made a Lunge and Fell on Top of the Little Elephant Which Began to Make a Noise Like a Baby.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Pa and a cowboy and some negroes lifted
the little elephant up into a tree, and the
whole herd surrounded us, and were going
to tear down the tree, when the camp was
alarmed and Hagenbach came out with all
the men and the negroes on horseback, and
they drove the herd into a canyon, and built
a fence across the entrance, and there we
had about fifty elephants in the strongest
kind of a corral, and we climbed down from
the tree with the baby elephant and took it
to camp, and put it in a big bag that Pa’s
airship was shipped in, and we are feeding
the little animal on condensed milk and
dried apples.</p>

<p class='c018'>We have got a tame elephant that was
bought to use on the wild elephants, to
teach them to be good, and the next day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>after we cut hay for the elephants, Pa was
ordered to ride the tame elephant into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>corral, to get the wild animals used to society.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa didn’t want to go, but he had bragged
so much about the way he handled elephants
with the circus in the States that he couldn’t
back out, and so they opened the bars and
let Pa and his tame elephant in, and closed
the bars.</p>

<p class='c018'>I think the manager thought that would
be the end of Pa, and the men all went
back to camp figuring on whether there
would be enough left of Pa to bury or send
home by express, or whether the elephants
would walk on Pa until he was a part of the
soil. In about an hour we saw a white spot
on a rock above the canyon, waving a piece
of shirt, and we watched it with glasses, and
soon we saw a fat man climbing down on
the outside, and after a while Pa came sauntering
into camp, across the veldt, with his
coat on his arm, and his sleeves rolled up
like a canvasman in a show, singing, “A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Charge to Keep I Have.” Pa came up to
the mess tent and asked if lunch was not
ready, and he was surrounded by the men,
and asked how he got out alive. Pa said,
“Well, there is not much to tell, only when I
got into the corral the whole bunch made
a rush for me and my tame elephant. I
stood on my elephant and told them to lie
down, and they got down on their knees,
and then I made them walk turkey for a
while, and march around, and then they
struck on doing tricks and began to shove
my elephant and get saucy, so I stood up on
my elephant’s head and looked the wild
elephants in the eyes, and made them form
a pyramid until I could reach a tree that
grew over the bank of the canyon, and I
climbed out and slid down, as you saw me.
There was nothing to it but nerve,” and Pa
began to eat corned zebra and bread as
though he was at a restaurant.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Well, I think that old man is a wonder,”
said the cowboy, as he threw his lariat over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>one of the wives of the chief negro and drew
her across the cactus. “I think he is the
condemdest liar I ever run up against in all
my show experience,” said Mr. Hagenbach.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Now,” says Pa, as he picked his teeth
with a thorn off a tree, “tomorrow we got
to capture a mess of wild African lions, right
in their dens, ’cause the gasoline has come
by freight, and the airship is mended, and
you can look out for a strenuous session, for
I found a canyon where the lions are thicker
than prairie dogs in Arizona,” and Pa laid
down for a little sleeping sickness, so I
guess we will have the time of our lives tomorrow,
and Pa has promised me a baby
lion for a pet.</p>

<p class='c017'>The idea of air ships is all right in theory,
but they are never going to be a reliable
success. The trouble is you never know
what they are going to do next. They are
like a mule about doing things that are not

<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>the cowboy with the lasso and two others, a
German and a negro, got on the rigging,
and about fifty of us held on to the drag
rope, and Pa turned the nose of the machine
south towards where he had located a mess
of lions in a rocky gorge, and he was going
to ride over the opening to their den, and
let the cowboy lasso the old dog lion, and
choke the wind out of him, and drag him
to camp by the neck, but the airship just insisted
on going North, and it took the whole
crowd to hold her, and Pa was up there on
the bamboo frame talking profane, and giving
orders.</p>

<p class='c018'>She was up in the air about fifty feet, and
Pa pointed out the place where the lion’s
den was to the South about a mile, and told
us to drag the air ship tail first across the
veldt, to the other side of the den, and cut her
loose; so we dragged the ship away around
South of the den, taking us all the forenoon,
and we could see the lions on the rocks sunning
themselves and probably talking over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>in lion language what they would do to us if
we got fresh, and every little while they
would cough like a case of pneumonia, and
it made my hair raise, but Pa was so cool
he had to turn his collar up.</p>

<p class='c018'>After a few hours we got the ship in the
right place, about a quarter of a mile south
of the den, and Pa got the cowboy ready
with his lasso, and the German ready to
yell murder in his language, and the negro
ready to throw overboard for the lions to
eat, and Pa said, “Turn her loose,” and
we let go of the rope, and the ship sailed
right straight for the den, and we all climbed
upon a big rock to watch the proceedings.
It was the most exciting moment of my life,
except the time the fat woman in the circus
sat down in Pa’s lap, and crushed him beyond
recognition and they had to scrape
him up with case knives.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was Pa at the wheel, his eyes staring
ahead at the lions, all of the lion family
having come out of the den to see the air
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>ship, and the dog lion, the head of the household
waving his tail and making the air
fairly tremble with his roaring.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pretty soon the airship was right over the
den, the lasso was thrown over the dog lion’s
neck, and drawn tight, and he coughed and
strangled like a negro being lynched, and
then he turned tail and ran down into the
den in the rocks, with all the other lions
after him, dragging the ship back into the
entrance of the den, and closing the hole
completely, and we all rushed up and tied
the rope to trees, so the gas bag was right
over the hole, tight as a drum, and Pa got
down off the frame, and as Mr. Hagenbach
came up in a perspiration Pa said, “There’s
your lions, about a dozen of them captured
down in that hole; help yourselves,” and Pa
sat down on the ground like a man who had
conquered the world, and was waiting for
the applause. Mr. Hagenbach said that was
all right, so far as it had gone, but what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>he wanted was lions in cages, ready to ship
to Germany, and not down in a hole in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>ground that might be as deep as a copper
mine, with no elevator to bring the lions to
the surface. “Well,” said Pa, as he lit a
cigar, “there’s a perfectly good dog Numidian
lion, with a black mane, on the end of
that lasso, and all you got to do is to pull
him up, just as you would a muscalonge
on a line, and when he comes to the surface
after I have finished my cigar, I will hog
tie him and have him ready for shipment
quicker’n a wink,” and Pa yawned, as
though capturing wild lions was as easy
for him as catching mice in a trap.</p>

<div id='il_25'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/airship_pic25.png'><img src='images/airship_pic25.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“There’s Your Lions, About a Dozen Captured Down in That Hole; Help Yourselves,” Said Pa.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>So the crowd all got hold of the lasso and
began to pull up, and of all the snarling and
howling you ever heard, that beat the band.
The old lion seemed to catch on to everything
coming up, and all the other lions
roared until the rocks on which we stood
fairly trembled like there was an earthquake,
but the old dog kept coming and I
felt as though something terrible was going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>to happen, and I began to get farther away.
Pa knocked the ashes off his cigar and asked
the cowboy how much more rope there was
left, and was told about ten feet, so he told
them to let up a minute until the driver
drove the cage up to a point on the rock not
far from where the lion would come out, and
when the cage was ready and the door open,
so the lion could see a goat tied in the cage
eating hay, Pa said to the men to give a
few more jerks, and, by Gosh, pretty soon
the lion’s head and neck came out of the
hole, and he was the maddest looking animal
I ever saw, and the men looked scared.</p>

<p class='c018'>The lion was bracing with his front feet,
and using all kinds of language, but Pa was
the coolest man in the bunch. “Now, let
him rest a minute,” says Pa, “but hold the
line taut,” and Pa took out a bag of tobacco
and a piece of paper and rolled a cigarette,
and lit it, and we all looked at Pa in admiration
for his nerve.</p>

<p class='c018'>After puffing his cigarette a little, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>looking to see if the cage was entirely right,
he ordered the men who were not pulling
on the rope to line up in two lines from the
hole to the cage, like the honorary pall
bearers at a funeral, and told them not to
move until the lion was in the cage, and
when they were all in place, Pa said, “Now
jerk his head plumb off,” and the crowd
pulled and the lion came out of the hole mad
and frothing at the mouth. Pa stepped one
side and gave the lion a swift kick in the
ham, and the king of beasts put his tail between
his legs and started for the hearse
cage, and Pa said, “Get in there, you measly
cur dog,” and Pa followed him, kicking him
every jump, until the big lion rushed into
the cage and laid down, so completely conquered
that he bellowed pitifully when the
goat butted him off of the hay, and Pa
closed the door and locked it and turned to
Mr. Hagenbach and asked, “How many of
these vermin do you want?” and he said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“Now that we were about it we had better
get the whole bunch.” Pa said “all right,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>he was there after lions, and he wanted to
get the limit,” so they signalled camp for
some more cages, and Pa said we had better
have lunch right there on the rock beside
the airship in the shade, while he prepared
to catch the rest of the lions.</p>

<div id='il_26'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/airship_pic26.png'><img src='images/airship_pic26.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Get in There, You Measly Cur Dog,” Said Pa, Kicking the Big Lion at Every Jump.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Pa was attaching a long rubber hose to
the gas bag, and as he got it fastened and
reeled about fifty feet of the hose down in
the hole, Mr. Hagenbach said, “Say, old
man, I don’t want to kick on any of your
new inventions, but what are you going to
do now?” and Pa said, as he turned a faucet
in the gas bag and let the gas into the hose,
“Didn’t you ever drown gophers out of a
hole by pouring water in, until the gophers
came to the top strangling, and you put
them in a shot bag and let them chew your
fingers? Well, I am going to drown out
big gophers with gas, and in about fifteen
minutes after we have had lunch, you will
see the dammest procession of sneezing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>lions come up out of that hole that ever
were in captivity, and I want all of you
brave ducks to hold the bags over the hole,
and when you get a lion in a bag tie the bag
and roll the beast over the rock, see?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, they got the gunny sacks ready,
and after we had our lunch and the gas was
filling the hole good and plenty, there was
a lot of sneezing and roaring down the hole,
and Pa said the medicine was working all
right, and pretty soon Pa turned off the gas
and unscrewed the hose, and loosened the
ropes on the air ship so she sailed off across
the veldt for a block or so, and then the
trouble began.</p>

<p class='c018'>First a big she lion came up with a mess
of cubs, and they held the bag all right, but
she went right through it like a bullet
through cheese, and then there was an explosion
away down in the bowels of the
earth, from the toe nails of some unmanicured
lion striking fire on a flint stone, and
fire began to pour out of the hole, and about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>nine singed lions of all sizes came up out of
the hole scared to death, and the smell of
burned hair was awful.</p>

<p class='c018'>The lions began to cuff the men and they
stampeded down the rocks, leaving Pa and
two or three of us alone. Pa and I seized a
couple of the baby lions and started to run
for camp, and the lions took after us and
chased us awhile, until Pa got out of wind,
when we climbed trees with the cubs, and
the lions rolled in the grass to put out the
fire, and then they took to the jungle, and
Pa said when Roosevelt got to Africa and
shot a few singed lions, he would think it
was a new kind of beast.</p>

<p class='c018'>We got back to camp with the two cubs,
and called the roll to see who was missing,
and we found the natives had packed up and
moved away, claiming that the old man
was a devil who had produced a burning
mountain, and the whole country would be
devastated.</p>

<p class='c018'>We sent all our animals to the coast to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>be shipped to Berlin and moved our camp
up to the jungle, about fifty miles, where
there is a new tribe of natives, and where it
is said the country is inhabited with gorillas.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa says he is going to move a cage into
the gorilla country, and call the gorillas
around him, learn their language, get their
confidence, and eventually reform them and
bring them to realize that they are endowed
with certain inalienable rights, and teach
them white man’s customs, and Pa will do
it or die trying, but I don’t like the idea, as
it seems dangerous to Pa. Say, those gorillas
are bigger than John L. Sullivan, and
they hug like bears. Gee, but I want to see
gorillas hanging by their tails on trees, and
Pa says I may go with him.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Boy’s Pa Shows Bravery in the Jungles
in Africa—Four Gorillas Chase Pa—The
Boy and His Pa Don’t Sleep Much at
Night—The Boy Discovers a Marsh Full
of Wild Buffaloes.</p>

<p class='c017'>I do not know whether Pa is an expert in
hypnotism or what it is, but he certainly delivers
the goods when he goes after a wild
animal in the jungles of Africa, and he
shows bravery at times that astonishes
everybody, but he admits that he is a coward
at heart, and would run if anybody pulled
a gun on him, and I guess he would, but
you turn him loose in a wild animal congress
and he will be speaker and make the
whole bunch get on their knees.</p>

<p class='c018'>I was scared when Pa wanted to have a
cage with iron bars hauled into the jungle
where the gorillas live, and insisted that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>be left there alone for two days, with rations
to last a week, as he said he expected
to have some gorilla boarders to feed, but
Mr. Hagenbach let Pa have his way, and
the cage was hauled about eight miles into
the black wilderness, with great trees and
vines and suckes and gorillas all around
him, but Pa insisted on having a phonograph
full of jig tunes, and when we got the cage
located and Pa in it and were ready to leave,
I cried, and the whole crowd felt as though
we would never see Pa alive again, and it
was a sad parting.</p>

<p class='c018'>When we left Pa he was cooking some
bacon on an oil stove in the cage and frying
some eggs for his dinner, and as we took
the trail back to camp, in silence, we could
smell the bacon frying, and when we got a
mile or so away we heard music and stopped
to listen and could plainly hear the phonograph
playing “There will be a hot time,”
and Mr. Hagenbach said it reminded him
of a dirge.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>It was a long two days before we could
go back and find Pa’s remains, but the second
day we hiked out through the jungle
and into the woods. Pa had told us that
when we came after him to come quiet and
not disturb the menagerie, so when we got
near the place where we left Pa we slowed
down and crept up silently and peeked
through the bushes and a sight met our
eyes that scared me.</p>

<p class='c018'>There were four big gorillas and several
little ones around the cage, and some were
gnawing ham bones and others were eating
dog biscuits, but it was so silent in the cage
that I thought Pa had been killed and that
the gorillas were eating him, so I yelled,
“Pa, are you all right?” and he answered
back, “You bet your sweet life I am all
right,” and then we prepared to go the cage,
when Pa said for us to climb trees, and just
then the gorillas started for us with their
teeth gleaming, and we all shinned up the
trees around the cage, and we had front
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>seats at the biggest show on earth. Pa told
us that the gorillas that treed us were afraid
we were going to harm him, and they proposed
to protect him.</p>

<p class='c018'>He said he had been feeding the animals
for two days and had got their confidence
so he could make them understand what he
wanted them to do.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Now watch ’em dance when I turn on
the music,” and then Pa gave them the
“Merry Widow” waltz, and by gosh if a big
gorilla didn’t put his arm around his wife,
or some other gorilla’s wife, and dance barefooted
right there in front of the cage, and
all the rest joined in, and the baby gorillas
rolled over on the ground and laughed like
hyenas. Pa stopped the music and called
one big gorilla Rastus and told him to sit
down in the cactus, and the others did the
same, and Pa repeated an old democratic
speech of his, and they clapped their hands
just like a caucus. “Well, what do you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>know about that already,” said Mr. Hagenbach,
and then he asked Pa how he was going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>to capture them.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Pa Stopped the Music and Repeated an Old Democratic Speech of His and They Acted Just Like a Caucus.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Pa said he had them in the cage several
times and let them out, and when we got
ready to go to camp all he had to do was to
let the phonograph play “Supper is now
ready in the dining car,” and they would
come in and he would slip out and lock the
door and we could haul the cage to camp.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>All He Had to Do Was to Play “Supper is Now Ready in the Dining Car” on the Phonograph.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Well, you ought to have seen my old
gentleman call the whole bunch of gorillas
into the cage and feed them and see them
act like a lot of boys in camp, reaching for
potatoes and bacon and wiping their lips on
their hairy arms, but none of them asked for
napkins or finger bowls. When the food
was all gone they began to kick like boarders
at a second-class boarding house, and
then Pa slipped out of the door and locked
it, and we came down out of the trees and
surrounded the cage, and Pa acted as barker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>and told us the names he had given to the
gorillas.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa brought the phonograph out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>cage and set it going and the gorillas began
to dance. Mr. Hagenbach was so pleased
that he fairly hugged Pa, and we got ready
to haul the cage to camp.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa always makes some mistake before he
has a proposition well in hand, and he did
this time, of course. As we were about to
start the gorilla Rastus, who had become
Pa’s chum, looked at Pa so pitiful that Pa
said he guessed he would let Rastus out and
he and Rastus would walk along ahead and
get the brush out of the road, so he opened
the door of the cage and beckoned to Rastus,
and the big gorilla came out with his oldest
boy, and Pa and the two of them took hold
of hands and started on ahead, and we
started to haul the wagon by drag ropes,
when the worst possible thing happened.
Rastus reached in Pa’s pistol pocket, where
Pa had just put a large plug of tobacco after
he had bit off a piece, and Rastus thought
because Pa ate the tobacco he could, so he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>bit off about half of the plug and ate it and
gave his half-grown boy the rest of it, and
that was eaten by the boy. Pa tried to take
it away from them, but it was too late, and
they were both mad at Pa for trying to beat
them out of their dessert.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was not long before Rastus turned pale
around the mouth, but his face was so covered
with hair that you couldn’t tell exactly
how sick he was; though, when he put both
hands on his stomach, gave a yell and turned
some somersaults, we knew he was a pretty
sick gorilla, and his boy rolled over and
clawed his stomach and had a fit.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rastus had the most pained and revengeful
look on his face I ever saw, and he looked
at Pa as though he was to blame.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa had one of the men get the medicine
chest, and Pa fixed two seidlitz in a tin cup,
but before he could put in the water Rastus
had swallowed the powder from the white
and blue paper and reached for a wash basin
of water, and before Pa could prevent Rastus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>from drinking it on top of those powders,
he had swallowed every drop of the
water, and the commotion inside of him
must have been awful, for he frothed at the
mouth and the bubbles came out of his nose,
and he rolled over and yelled like a man
with gout, and he seemed to swell up, and
Pa looked on as though he had a case on his
hands that he couldn’t diagnose, while Rastus’
boy just laid on the ground and rolled
his eyes as though he were saying his “Now
I lay me,” and Mr. Hagenbach said to Pa he
guessed he had broke up the show, and Pa
said, “Never you mind, I will pull them
both through all right.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Finally the siedlitz powder fiz had all got
out of Rastus’ system and he seemed to be
thinking deeply for a moment, and then he
got off his haunches and looked steadily
into Pa’s eyes for a minute, and then he
took Pa by one hand and his boy with the
other and started right off through the
jungle, Pa pulling back and yelling to us to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>rescue him from the gorilla kidnapers, but
Rastus walked fast and before he had got
ought of sight he had picked his sick boy up
and carried him under his arm and both were
groaning, and he held on to Pa’s hand and
went so fast that Pa’s feet only hit the high
places.</p>

<p class='c018'>The gorillas in the cage looked at them
disappear and tried to get out of the cage to
go along, but they couldn’t get out.</p>

<p class='c018'>Finally Mr. Hagenbach said me, “Hennery,
I guess your Pa has got what is coming
to him this time. Rastus will probably
drag your Pa up a tree and eat him when
his appetite comes back, but we can’t help
him, so we better haul the cage and the
gorillas that have not had any tobacco to
camp, and in a day or two we will all come
out here and find your father’s bones and
bury them.”</p>

<p class='c018'>And then we all went to camp, and the
poor gorillas just remained listlessly in the
cage, mourning as though they knew Rastus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>and his boy were dead. We fed them everything
we could spare, but they would not
eat, and by watching them we found there
was a case of jealousy in the cage, as two
male gorillas seemed to be stuck on a young
female, and they were scrapping all the time.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gee, but we needed Pa worse than ever to
settle the gorilla dispute, but we all felt that
Pa was not of this earth any more, and the
camp took on an air of mournfulness, and
they all wanted to adopt me, ’cause I was
alone in the world. There was not much
sleep in camp that night, and the next day
we were going out with guns to find Pa’s
remains and shoot Rastus, but a little after
daylight we heard the night watchman say
to the cook, who was building a fire, “Look
who’s here, and what do you know about
that,” and he called the whole camp up, and
we looked out across the veldt and there
came Pa astradle of a Zebra, with Rastus’
boy up behind him and Rastus thoroughly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>subdued, leading the Zebra with a hay rope
Pa had twisted out of grass.</p>

<p class='c018'>The whole camp came to attention and Pa
scratched a match on Rastus’ hair and
lighted a cigarette, and when he got near
enough he said: “Slept in the crotch of a
tree all night. Gave Rastus and his boy a
drink of whiskey out of my flask and cured
them of the tobacco sickness, had some
mangoes for breakfast, sent Rastus to catch
a Zebra, and here we are ready for coffee and
pancakes.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa got off his zebra, opened the door of
the cage and pointed to it, and Rastus and
his boy got in, and Pa kicked Rastus right
where the hair was worn off sitting down,
and Rastus looked at Pa as though that was
all right and he deserved it. Then Pa closed
the door, washed his hands and sat down to
breakfast, and when Mr. Hagenbach said,
“Old man, you have got Barnum and Forepaugh
skinned a mile,” Pa said, “O that is
nothing; I have located a marsh full of wild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Buffaloes, and we will go out there and get
a drove of them in a few days.</p>

<p class='c018'>“They are the ugliest and fightingest animals
in the world, but I will halter break
some of them and ride them without any
saddle.” Mr. Hagenbach said he believed
it, and Pa said, “Hennery, one spell I
thought you would be an orphan, but
whiskey saved you. When they got a big
drink of whiskey they began to laugh, and
then fell on my neck and cried, just like a
white man when he is too drunk to fight.
Well, I am going to take a nap,” and Pa laid
down on a bale of hay and slept all day, and
the crowd talked about what a hero he was.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Boy’s Experience With an African
Buffalo—The Boy’s Pa Shoots Roman
Candles to Scare the Buffaloes—The
Boy’s Pa Tames the Wild Animals.</p>

<p class='c017'>When Pa told us that he had located a
place where we could get all the wild African
buffalo that we wanted, I thought of the
pictures I had seen of the killing of buffaloes
in America, where all the buffalo hunter had
to do was to ride a horse after a herd of the
animals, that couldn’t run faster than a yoke
of oxen, pick out a big bull and ride alongside
of him and fire bullets into his vital
parts at about ten feet range, until his liver
was filled full of holes and he had the nose
bleed, and when he fell down from loss of
blood, dismount and skin him for a lap robe.
The American buffalo would always run
away and the hunter could kill him if he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>cartridges enough, and never be in any more
danger than a farmer milking a cow.</p>

<p class='c018'>I thought we would have about the same
kind of experience with African buffalo, only
we intended to lasso them and bring them
to camp alive for the show business, but instead
of the African buffalo running away
from you, he runs at you on sight and tries
to gouge out your inside works with his
horns, and paws you with his hoofs, and
when he gets you down he kneels down on
you and runs horns all through your system
and rolls over on your body like a setter dog
rolling on an old dead fish.</p>

<p class='c018'>The African buffalo certainly has a
grouch, as though he had indigestion from
eating cactus thorns, and when he sees a
man his eyes blaze with fire and he gets as
crazy as an anarchist and seems to combine
in his make-up the habits of the hyena, the
tiger, the man-eating shark and the Texas
rattlesnake.</p>

<p class='c018'>I wouldn’t want such an animal for a pet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>but Pa said the way to get buffaloes was to
go after them and never let up until you had
them under your control. So we started out
under Pa’s lead to capture African buffalo,
and while the returns are not all in of the
dead and wounded, we know that our expedition
is pretty near used up.</p>

<p class='c018'>These African buffaloes live in a marsh,
where the grass and cane grows high above
them, and the only way you can tell where
they are is to watch the birds flying around
and alighting on the backs of the animals to
eat wood ticks and gnats. The marsh is so
thick with weeds that a man cannot go into
it, so we planned to start the airship on the
windward side of the marsh, after lining up
the whole force of helpers, negroes and white
men, and building a corral of timber on the
lee side of the marsh. Pa and the cowboy
and I went in the airship, with those honk-honk
horns they have on automobiles, and
those megaphones that are used at football
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>games, and Pa had a bunch of Roman
candles to scare the buffaloes.</p>

<p class='c018'>When the fence was done, which fifty
men had worked on for a week, it run in the
shape of a triangle or a fish net, with a big
corral at the middle. Mr. Hagenbach sent
up a rocket to notify Pa that he was ready
to have him scare the buffaloes out of the
marsh, down the fence into the corral.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa had the gas bag all full, a mile across
the marsh, tied to a tree with a slip noose,
so when we all got set he could pull a string
and untie the slip noose.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, everything worked bully, and when
Pa tied her loose we went up into the air
about fifty feet, and Pa steered the thing up
and down the marsh like a pointer dog ranging
a field for chickens.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was the greatest sight I ever witnessed,
seeing more than two hundred buffalo heads
raise up out of the tall grass and watch the
airship, looking as savage as lions eating
raw meat.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>First they never moved at all, but we began
to blow the honk horns, and then we
yelled through the megaphones to “get out
of there, you sawed off short horns,” and
then they began to move away from the airship
across the marsh, and we followed until
they began to get into a herd, nearly on the
other side of the marsh, but they only
walked fast, splashing through the mud.</p>

<p class='c018'>When we got almost across the marsh Pa
said now was the time to fire the Roman
candles, so we each lit our candle, and the
fire and smoke and the fire balls fairly
scorched the hair of the buffaloes in the rear
of the herd, and in a jiffy the whole herd
stampeded out of the marsh right toward
the fence, bellowing in African language,
scared half to death, the first instance on record
that an African buffalo was afraid of
anything on earth.</p>

<p class='c018'>We followed them until they got to the
fence, but only about one hundred got into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>the corral, the others going around the fence
and chasing the keepers into the jungle and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>hooking the negroes in the pants, and some
of the negroes are running yet, and will, no
doubt, come out at Cairo, Egypt.</p>

<p>Some of Those Negroes Are Running Yet, and Will No Doubt Come Out at Cairo, Egypt.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Mr. Hagenbach and the white men got up
in trees and watched Pa and the airship, and
when we got where the fence narrowed up
at the corral Pa let the airship come down to
the ground and anchored it to a stump and
yelled for the boss of the expedition and the
men to come down out of the trees and help
capture some of the best specimens; so they
came down and tore out the wings of the
fence and placed them across so we had the
buffaloes in a pen, and then Mr. Hagenbach,
who had been getting a little jealous of Pa,
came up to him and shook his hand and told
him he was a wonder in the capturing of
wild animals, and Pa said don’t mention it,
and Pa took the makings and made himself
a cigarette and smoked up, and Mr. Hagenbach
asked Pa how we were going to get
the buffaloes out of the corral, ’cause they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>were fighting each other in the far end of the
pen, and Pa said you just wait, and he sent
for the cages, enough to hold about ten of
the buffaloes, and we let the gas out of the
airship and went into camp right there, and
Pa bossed things for about two days, until
the buffaloes got good and hungry, and then
we backed the cages up to an opening in the
fence and put hay in the far end of the cages,
and the herd began to take notice.</p>

<p class='c018'>We wanted the big bulls and some cows,
and nature helped us on the bulls, ’cause
they fought the weaker ones away from the
cages, and walked right up the incline into
the cages, and Pa went in and locked the
doors, and when we got the cages full of
bulls and started to haul the cages to camp
by the aid of some of the negroes who had
returned alive, by jingo, the cows followed
the cages with the bulls in, and you couldn’t
drive them away.</p>

<p class='c018'>We loaded the gas bag on to a sort of
stone boat, and Pa rigged up a couple of ox
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>yokes and in some way hypnotized a few
cow buffaloes so he could drive them, and
they hauled the stone boat with the airship
to camp, and we got there almost as soon as
the cages did, and Pa was smoking as contented
as though he was walking on Broadway,
and with an ox gad he would larrup
the oxen and say, “Haw Buck,” like a farmer
driving oxen to plow a field.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa got his wild oxen so tame before we
got to camp that they would eat hay out of
his hand, and when we rounded up in our
permanent camp and looked over our stock
and killed some of the buffaloes that had followed
the cages, for meat for the negroes,
and lit some sky rockets and fired them at the
balance of the herd to drive them away from
camp, the negroes, who had always had a
horror of meeting wild buffaloes, thought
Pa was a superior being to be able to tame a
whole herd of the most savage animals, and
they got down on their knees and placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>their faces in the dust in front of Pa and
worshipped him, and they wouldn’t get up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>off the ground until Pa had gone around and
put his feet on the necks of all the negroes
in token that he acknowledged himself to be
their king and protector, and the wives of
the negroes all threw their arms around Pa
and hugged him until he got tired, and he
said he had rather fight buffaloes than be
hugged by half naked negro women that
hadn’t had a bath since Stanley discovered
them, but Pa appreciated the honor, and Mr.
Hagenbach said Pa was the greatest man in
the world.</p>

<p>Pa Had to Put His Foot on Their Necks and Acknowledge Himself Their King and Protector.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The next day we shipped the buffaloes to
the coast and had them sent to Berlin, and
when we got the mail from headquarters
there was an order for a lot more tigers, so
I suppose we will be tigering as soon as the
open season is on.</p>

<p class='c018'>The idea is that we must get all the animals
we can this year, for it is rumored that
Roosevelt is coming to Africa next year to
shoot big game, and all of us feel that wild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>animals will be scarce after he has devastated
Africa.</p>

<p class='c018'>We got short of Salt Pork, and some time
ago Pa salted down some sides of rhinoceros,
and yesterday was the day to open the
barrel. Pa showed the cooks how to fry
rhinoceros pork, and I tell you it made you
hungry to smell rhinoceros frying, and with
boiled potatoes and ostrich eggs and milk
gravy, made from elephant milk, we lived
high, but the next day an epidemic broke
out, and they laid it to Pa’s rhinoceros
pork dinner, but Pa says any man who eats
eight or nine fried ostrich eggs is liable to
indigestion.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gee, but this is a great country to enjoy
an outing in.</p>

  <h2 id='ch_XVIII.' class='c008'>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The Boy and His Pa Start for the Coast in
an Airship—Pa Saluted the Crowd as We
Passed Over Them—The Airship Lands
Amid a Savage Tribe—The King of the
Tribe Escorts Pa and the Boy to the
Palace.</p>

<p class='c017'>The animal capturing season is pretty
near over, and we have had a meeting of all
the white men connected with the expedition
and decided to break up the camp and
take our animals to the coast and sail back
to Europe and to the States.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was decided that Pa and I and the cowboy
and a negro dwarf belonging to a tribe
we have been trying to locate should start
for the coast in the airship, and the rest of
the crowd should go with the cages, and all
round up at a place on the coast in three
weeks, when we could catch a boat for Hamburg,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Germany. So we got the airship ready
and made gas enough to last us a week and
filled the tank that furnishes the power for
the screw wheel with gasoline, and in a couple
of days we were ready to let her go Gallagher.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a sad parting for Pa, ’cause all
the captured animals wanted to shake hands
with him, and some of them acted more human
than some of the white men, and when
the cages were all hitched up and ready to
move and the negroes had been paid off and
given a drink of rum and a zebra sandwich,
Mr. Hagenbach embraced Pa, and Pa got up
on the framework of the ship and took hold
of the gear, and we got on and Pa told them
to cut her loose, and a little after daylight
we sailed away towards the coast and left
the bunch we had been with so long with
moistened eyes. Pa saluted the crowd and
throwed a kiss to the big ourang outang
which had become almost like a brother to
Pa, the drivers whipped up the horses and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>oxen hitched to the cages, and as the procession
rattled along to the main road going
south Pa said, “Good-bye, till we meet
again,” and just then the wind changed, and
in spite of all Pa could do the airship turned
towards the north and ran like a scared wolf
the wrong way.</p>

<p class='c018'>The procession had got out of sight, or
Pa would have pulled the string that lets the
gas escape, and come down to the ground;
but he realized that if we landed alone we
would starve to death and be eaten by wild
animals, so he let her sail right away from
where we wanted to go, and we all said our
prayers and prayed for the wind to change
again.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gee, but we sailed over a beautiful country
for an hour or two, hills and valleys and
all kinds of animals in sight all the time, but
now we didn’t want any more animals,
’cause we had no place to keep them. But
the animals all seemed to want us. The
lions we passed over would roar at us, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>tigers would snarl, the hyenas would laugh
at Pa, the zebras on the plains we passed
over would race along with us and kick up
their heels like colts in a pasture, and the
cowboy stood straddle of the bamboo frame
and just itched to throw his lasso over a fine
zebra, but Pa told him to let ’em alone,
’cause we didn’t want to be detained.</p>

<p class='c018'>We passed over rivers where hippopotamusses
were as thick as suckers in a spring
freshet, and they lookd at us as though they
wouldn’t do a thing to the airship if we
landed in their midst.</p>

<p class='c018'>We passed over rhinoceroses with horns
bigger than any we had ever seen, and we
passed over a herd of more than a hundred
elephants, and they all gave us the laugh.</p>

<p class='c018'>We passed over gnus and springboks and
deer of all kinds, and when they heard the
propellor of the airship rattle, they would
look up and snort and run away in all directions.
Some giraffes were feeding in the tree
tops at one grove, and Pa let the ship down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>a little so we could count the spots on them,
and I had a syphon of seltzer water, and I
squirted it in the face of a big giraffe, and he
sneezed like a cat that has got a dose of
smelling salts, and then the whole herd
stampeded in a sort of hipty-hop, and we
laughed at their awkwardness.</p>

<p class='c018'>We sailed along over more animals than
we ever thought there were in the world, and
over thatched houses in villages, where the
negroes would come out and take a look at
us and then fall on their knees and we could
see their mouths work as though they were
saying things.</p>

<p class='c018'>Along towards noon Pa yelled to the cowboy
that we would have to land pretty soon,
and to get the drag rope ready, ’cause we
were going the wrong way to hit the coast,
and the first big village we came in sight of
he was going to land and take our chances.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pretty soon a big village loomed up ahead
on a high plane near a river, with more than
a hundred houses and fields of corn and potatoes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>and grain all around it, and one big
house like about forty hay stacks all in one,
and Pa gave the word to stand by, and when
we got near the village the whole population
came out beating tom-toms and waving their
shirts, and Pa pulled the string, some of
the gas escaped, and we came down in a
sort of plaza right in the center of the village,
and tied the drag rope to a tree and
anchored the gas bag at both ends.</p>

<p class='c018'>The crowd of negroes stood back in
amazement and waited for the king of the
tribe to come out of the big shack, and
while he was getting ready to show up we
looked around at the preparations for a
feast which we had noticed.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a regular barbecue, and the little
dwarf we had brought along began to sniff
at the stuff that was being roasted over the
fire, and Pa looked at him and asked him
what the layout was all about, and the
dwarf, who had learned to speak a little English,
got on his knees and told Pa the sky
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>ship had landed in the midst of his own
tribe, where he had been stolen from a year
ago by another tribe, and that the feast was
a canibal feast, got up in honor of the tribal
Thanksgiving, and that the bodies roasting
were members of another tribe that had been
captured in a battle, and the dwarf got up
and began to talk to his old friends and
neighbors, and he evidently told them we
were great people, having rescued him from
the tribe that stole him, and had brought
him back home in the sky ship, safe and
sound.</p>

<p class='c018'>The people began to kneel down to Pa and
worship him, but Pa said it made him sick
to smell that stuff cooking, and he told us
that he felt our end had come, ’cause we had
landed in a cannibal country, and they would
cook us and eat us as sure as cooking.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa said if they roasted him and tried to
eat him they would find they had a pretty
tough proposition, but he thought the cowboy
and I would make pretty good eating.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>We got our Winchesters and revolvers off
the airship and got ready to fight if necessary,
when suddenly all of the negroes,
dwarfs and full-grown negroes, got down on
the ground and kissed the earth, all in two
lines, and up to the far end of the line, near
the king’s house, out came the king of the
tribe, dressed like a vaudeville performer,
and he marched down between the lines with
stately tread towards Pa and the cowboy
and your little Hennery.</p>

<p class='c018'>He had on an old plug hat, fifty years old
at least, evidently only worn on occasions of
ceremony, and the rest of him was naked,
except a shirt made of grass, which was
buckled around his waist, and he carried an
empty tomatoe can in one hand and a big oil
can, such as kerosene is shipped in, in the
other, and around his neck was a lot of
empty pint beer bottles strung on a piece of
copper wire, and he had his nose and ears
pierced, and in the holes he wore tin tags
that came off of plugs of tobacco.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>He was a sight sure enough, but he was
as dignified as a southern negro driving a
hack. Pa kept his nerve with him, rolled a
cigarette, scratched a match on the seat of
his pants and lighted it, and blew smoke
through his nostrils and looked mad as he
laid his Winchester across his left arm. The
cowboy was trembling, but he had his gun
ready, and I was monkeying with an automatic
revolver, and the King came right up
to Pa and looked Pa over, and walked around
him, making signs. Then he looked at the
airship and gas bag and sniffed at the feast
cooking, and finally his eye fell on the dwarf,
who had been mourned as dead, and he called
the dwarf one side to talk to him, and Pa
said to the dwarf, “Tell him we have just
dropped down from Heaven to inspect the
tribe and take an account of stock.” The
king and the dwarf talked awhile, and then
the king came up to Pa and got down on his
knees and in pigeon English, broken by
sobs, he informed Pa that he recognized that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Pa had been sent from Heaven to take the
position of king of the tribe, and he announced
to the tribe that gathered around
him that he abdicated in Pa’s favor, and
turned his tribe, lands, stock and mines over
to the Heaven-sent white man, and for them
to look upon Pa as king and escort him to
the palace and turn over to him all his property,
wives, ivory, copper and gold, and he
would go jump in the lake, and in token of
abdication he turned over to Pa the plug hat,
and was taking off the beer bottles from
around his neck when Pa stopped the deal
and said he would take charge of the property
and the palace, but he would not have
the wives or the hat, and he would try to
govern the tribe so it would soon take its
place besides the kingdoms of Europe, but
the old king must sit on his right hand as
adviser and friend and run the family.</p>

<p class='c018'>The king agreed, and the tribe escorted
Pa and the cowboy and me to the palace
and placed Pa on the throne, the cowboy on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>the left, the old king on the right and me at
Pa’s feet, and then about one hundred of the
king’s wives came in with cow tails tied
around their waists and danced before Pa,
and Pa covered his eyes and said to the cowboy,
“Take this thing easy and don’t get rattled
and we will get out of it some way, but
I’ll be cussed if I eat any of that roasted
nigger.”</p>

<p class='c018'>After they danced awhile a tom-tom
sounded afar off and the crowd started for
the feast, and some niggers brought in a
tray of meat for us, but Pa said we were
vegetarians and the great Spirit would be offended
if we ate meat, and Pa made a sign
of distress, and they took away the boiled
ham of a colored person and brought us some
green corn and sweet potatoes, and then they
all drank something out of gourds, and all
got drunk except the old king and Pa and
the cowboy.</p>

<p class='c018'>When everybody was good and drunk Pa
called us all into executive session and took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>charge of the affairs of the tribe, and we
were assigned to a room, as it was night, and
when we got in and shut the door Pa says
to the cowboy, “How does this compare with
life with the Digger Indians?” and the cowboy
said, “This takes the cake,” and Pa examined
the old king’s valuables and found
gold enough to pay the national debt, and
diamonds by the quart, as big as walnuts,
and Pa said, “This sure looks good to me,
and we will tarry a while. You plug up that
gas bag so no guilty gas can escape, and
some day we will load up with diamonds and
things and make a quick get away.”</p>

<p class='c017'>This being a king over a few thousand
negroes, the position Pa holds, with the
regular king of the tribe reduced to the occupation
of interpreter to the white king,
has its drawbacks, and Pa is getting pretty
sick of it, the cowboy that it with us is discouraged,
and I have no one to play with
but some coons who never cared for anything
but to feast on human flesh, sleep and
fight among themselves, so Pa is arranging
to skip out some morning with the airship
when we get our hands on the gold and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>diamonds this tribe have hidden around the
camp. But in the meantime we are educating
these Africans into the methods of civilization.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa has issued an edict that the eating of
human flesh must cease, and he has explained
to them that the Great Spirit will
have it in for any person that kills except
in self defense, and that all who are cannibals
will never get to Heaven, and the whole tribe
has sworn off on eating the bodies of human
beings, and Pa has taught them the way to
broil a beef steak, and they can’t get enough
of it. They never knew what it was to eat
the flesh of cattle, but just raised cattle for
the hides, and to sell at the Railroad stations,
but they never knew what the white
buyers did with the cattle.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa has showed them how to dig wells,
and get good water to drink, instead of
drinking surface water and liquor made out
of some kind of berries, that makes you
drunk to smell of it.</p>

He got on the zebra with his lariat rope and
put the spurs to the animal and rode through
the camp and threw his rope over the old
ex-king and tightened it up around his neck,
just to show what he could do, and the zebra
ran away and dragged the king through the
chaparral and came near killing him, but Pa
explained to the old king that the cowboy
was the agent of the Great Spirit, and was
trying out the king to see if he had patience,
and could take a joke without letting his
angry passions rise, and that if he could and
could smile at adversity, he would be looked
upon as one of the elect.</p>

were roped and dragged around by the neck,
and they enjoyed it.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Pa’s diplomatic talk to the negro king so
impressed him that he wanted the cowboy
to rope Pa, and drag him some, but Pa
pointed his finger to the sky and said he was
so good that no rope could touch him. Gee,
but those niggers are easy marks.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa and the cowboy have been training the
male members of the tribe in the military
drill, and we have got eight Companies that
can march by fours and in platoons, and
come into line just like soldiers, and they
are proud of what they can do, but they only
use clubs for guns, though Pa has promised
them that when he gets money enough he
will buy Winchesters for the whole army,
and we will go and wipe out a tribe about
twenty miles away, and take all their gold
and diamonds, and they are going to dig up
their gold and diamonds and give them to
Pa to buy guns. That is about when we will
skip out for the coast and sail for Paris and
New York.</p>

<p class='c018'>I suppose I ought to be killed, but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>couldn’t help having some fun with Pa’s
colored troops. One night Pa had brought
them into line, after drilling them, and had
made them break ranks and sit down around
the big camp fire while the women served a
barbecue banquet.</p>

<p class='c018'>All day the women had been cooking an
ox and some pigs over a big fire, under Pa’s
supervision, cause Pa used to be a soldier
and a politician and had superintended
political barbecues lots of times, and he had
the meat cooked so nice that wild animals
had come near camp to smell of the barbecue,
and Pa’s soldiers sat there watering at the
mouth, and thinking how much better oxen
and pigs were for food than human beings,
and Pa felt that he had made a big triumph
for civilization, and that his name would be
handed down to future generations with the
names of Stanley, Livingston and Roosevelt.</p>

<p class='c018'>The negroes were resting around the fire,
talking over the day’s drilling, and how,
when they got the guns Pa was going to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>buy for them, they would go on the war
path, when the women began to bring the
food, the meat cut up in chunks, and sweet
potatoes on big leaves and straw mats, and
all began to eat like wild animals. It was
too peaceful a scene for me to enjoy, so I
went to a knapsack that I brought along
from Paris, and got out my fireworks, which
I always carry along for emergencies.</p>

<p class='c018'>I got about a dozen nigger chasers and
some Roman candles, and told the cowboy
I was going to have some fun scaring Pa’s
troops, to see if they were brave enough to
fight an enemy.</p>

<div id='il_32'  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Told the Cowboy I Was Going to Have Some Fun Scarring Pa’s Troops.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The cowboy had been drinking some
berry juice and he said he would assist at
the Fourth of July celebration by taking his
Winchester and firing at some of the jackals
and hyenas that had been attracted by the
barbecue smell, just as I touched off my
fireworks.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, it was a crime to do it, but what
is a boy going to do when he is away off in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>strange country and he has to create his
own fun.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, just as the troops had got filled up
with the meal, and the women who had
served the banquet had sat down with the
colored soldiers to eat what was left, and
everybody was laughing, and Pa stood up
by a tree in the light of the fire, like a fat
statue, patting himself on the back and
thinking he was the greatest man since
Julius Caeser, I got a coal of fire and touched
off my nigger chasers and pointed them
towards the crowd sitting around the fire,
and touched off a pinwheel I had fastened
to a tree by a thorn, and opened up my battery
of Roman candles, pointing them at Pa
and the ex-king, who were the only ones
standing up, and the cowboy cut loose with
the Winchester at the wild animals, with a
cowboy yell such as they give when they
are shooting up a town out west.</p>

<p class='c018'>O my, O my! I hope I may live to see
another such a circus some day, but I guess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>not, for if Pa does not kill me the niggers
will, if they ever come back. Those nigger
chasers started the stampede. You know
how nigger chasers such as boys use in
America, rush around in every direction
spitting fire, and acting like crazy snakes.
Well, they went into that crowd like pizen,
run up the legs of the men, and chased the
women, and there was a stampede for fair.
Men and women fell over each other, clawed
hair and got on their knees and said their
“now I lay me,” dodged the nigger chasers,
and when they got away from one chaser another
one would meet them and run up their
frames and jump off and go for another and
there was the scardest bunch of negroes that
ever danced a war dance, and when the balls
from the Roman candles began to strike all
around Pa and the old king, and the pinwheel
began to revolve, and spatter out different
colored lights, and the cowboy’s Winchester
boomed, and the wounded jackals
howled, and a lion that got pretty near the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>camp let out a roar that shook the earth the
whole crowd made for the woods and I
touched off a rocket and let it go into the
crowd there was a breaking of brush and a
yelling in the negro dialect, and all that was
left around the campfire was Pa and the
cowboy and your little Hennery.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa knew what was the trouble. He knew
it was his little boy that created the disturbance.
“They’re off” says I, walking up to
Pa, and putting my arm around him. “That
scarce pays me for all I have suffered since
I came to Africa on this fool expedition,”
said the cowboy, as he picked up a piece of
roast pig and began to gnaw it. “Hennery,”
says Pa, picking up a club, “You have
stampeded the noblest army in Africa, and
broken up a tribe that were my subjects,
and left me a white king with nothing to
king it over; you have broken up the whole
show and I must proceed to kill you.”</p>

<p class='c018'>I dodged and gave Pa the laugh, and told
him his tribe would be back in the morning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>and he could make up a story that the Great
Spirit had become offended at the tribe, and
turned loose the elements on them, and Pa
said, “Good idea, Hennery,” and we climbed
trees to sleep while the hyenas came into
camp and ate up the remains of the banquet.
Pa said, “Hennery, you always raise hades
on your watch, but I fear you have overdone
it this time,” and I said to Pa, “You
wait till daylight and the whole bunch will
be back here worshipping you because they
think you are a baldheaded God, see?” and
Pa said, “Mebby, boy, mebby so.”</p>

Take Him for Mr. Roosevelt.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have spent a good many terrible nights
in my time, but I never spent such a night
as I did up the tree, the night I fired the
nigger chasers into the barbecue crowd in
Africa, with hyenas and jackals sitting on
their haunches and looking up at us, licking
their chops, and yapping for us to come
down and be chewed.</p>

<p class='c018'>Once when I was quite a bit younger, a
party of us boys went to rob a melon patch,
and the farmer shot us in the pants with
rock salt, and chased us up a tree, while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>dogs stood at the foot of the tree all night
and barked, and the salt in our wounds was
making us smart awful, but it was not so
dangerous as this hyena stunt.</p>

<p class='c018'>Once I went home from church with a
girl, and on the way back home the father
of the girl came out with a ghost sheet over
him, with phosphorus eyes, and scared me
into a hen coop, and as I was praying to die,
a negro with a dark lantern came to steal the
chickens, and when he saw me in the coop
he gave me some chickens he had stolen from
another coop, and he run one way and I run
the other, and I guess he went around the
world one way and I the other, and we met
last night at the barbecue, sure, and he
started back around the world the other way
when my fireworks went off.</p>

<p class='c018'>But I was not as scared in the hen coop,
with the ghost and the frightened negro,
as I was up the tree, looking down the
throats of the hyenas, with the lions howling
around sniffing at the remains of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>barbecue, and a few tigers waving their tails
from side to side, waiting for us to drop off
the limbs.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa went to sleep a-straddle of a limb because
he was tired, and the cowboy went to
sleep on another limb because he was drunk,
and your little Hennery was on watch, crying
to be put to bed.</p>

<p class='c018'>When daylight came the animals slunk
away into the jungle, and when it got light
enough I could see black faces peering
through the bushes trying to find out if it
was safe to return, so I woke Pa and the
cowboy, and told Pa his subjects were coming
into camp to cut his liver out, and toast
it on a forked stick, and Pa climbed down
from the tree and kicked the fire, and as the
negroes began to come nearer he said, “Welcome
to our beautiful city.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Pretty soon all of the tribe returned, but
they did not kowtow to Pa like they used
to, until the old king showed up.</p>

<p class='c018'>He was so scared he was fairly pale, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>he had a grouch too, and Pa noticed it, for he
said to the cowboy, “You go and fill that gas
bag and get ready to sail, because there is
going to be a mutiny, and we have got to
get out of this country pretty precious, or
they will eat us,” and the cowboy went to
work to inflate the gas bag.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa stood around trying to look like a
saint, and he pointed to the sun, just rising
over the hills, and got on his knees to worship
the sun, and motioned for all the tribe
to do likewise, but they turned their backs
on Pa and the sun, and surrounded the old
king whose place Pa had usurped, and by
the motions they made and the few words
I could understand it was evident they proposed
to drive us out of the tribe. The old
king came to Pa and said his tribe wanted to
have peace again, and wanted him to run
the shebang, and they wanted an old fashioned
cannibal feast, and that they insisted
on eating Pa and the cowboy and myself
roasted. Pa said all right, he was willing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>be roasted in the evening but not in the
morning. He said white meat always
tasted better in the evening, after a ride up
in the clouds, and he propsed to the old
king that we all three, with the king, take
a nice ride in the sky cart, take along all
the gold we had, and visit an adjoining
tribe, buy all their wives, and herd them, and
let the cowboy drive them back to camp and
then they could roast us and have the time
of their lives.</p>

<div id='il_33'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/airship_pic33.png'><img src='images/airship_pic33.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>They Turned Their Backs On Pa and the Sun.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>This looked good to the old king, and
he went and dug up all the gold and diamonds
they had, and put them in a bag,
which was tied to the bamboo frame of the
airship, and after breakfast we got ready
to sail.</p>

<p class='c018'>We fixed a sort of chair for the king to
ride in, tied with rawhide to a cross stick
right in front of where the cowboy always
sits, and I heard Pa whisper to the cowboy
that he would head the ship direct to the
coast, and when we got away from camp a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>few miles, Pa would give the signal and the
cowboy was to cut the rawhide rope and let
the king take a fall out of himself.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa steered the airship South, and occasionally
the negro king would yell and point
to the East, where the tribe was located
whose wives we had designs on, but Pa kept
his direction, and after running an hour or
so we came to a beautiful lake of blue water,
and Pa told the cowboy to get ready to
throw off about two hundred pounds of dead
weight. The cowboy said, “Aye, aye, sir,”
and got his knife ready. Pa let the airship
down about fifty feet above the water
of the lake, so the fall would not kill the
negro king, and when we got nearly across
the lake, Pa said, “Cut the rope,” and the
cowboy reached over with his knife and cut
it, and down went Mr. McGinty, hanging on
to the rope, and turning over in the air a
dozen times, and striking the surface of the
lake with a spash that shot the water up
nearly to the airship. “So long, you senegambian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>cannibal,” said Pa as the king
struck the water, and the airship shot up
about fifty feet higher.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Give my love to forty or fifty of your
wives,” said the cowboy as he sheathed his
knife. “Take that from your little Hennery,”
says I as I lit a giant firecracker and
threw it down near him, where it exploded
like a bomb. And then as we went along
through the air we watched him loosen himself
from the chair and strike out for the
shore, swearing in negro dialect that he
would eat us yet, without salt, and then we
got out of sight of the lake, laughing at our
escape and wondering where we would land.</p>

<div id='il_34'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/airship_pic34.png'><img src='images/airship_pic34.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Take That from Your Little Hennery.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>We sailed along for a couple of hours, and
passed over villages of natives, but Pa said
he would not take chances on another nigger
king, but would run the ship towards the
coast as long as the gas held out, and on we
went until after midday, when the gas bag
began to flap as though the gas was escaping,
and Pa acted nearly crazy, because we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>were over a dense jungle, filled with wild
animals, and not a thing to eat.</p>

<p class='c018'>After two o’clock P. M. we sighted a
clearing ahead, with nice modern houses, and
as we got nearer we could see herds of Jersey
cattle, and girafs, and horses and elephants,
and the queerest mixture of wild life
and civilization, and the nearer we got the
more it looked like a Yankee settlement, and
when Pa saw some automobiles and a tennis
court, with men, women and children
playing tennis and riding around in gasoline
and steam autos, and a creamery and
a wind mill and an ice house, he said that
was the place he was looking for, and he
pointed the airship for the clearing, and told
the cowboy to get the anchor ready.</p>

<p class='c018'>The people on the plantation saw the airship
and quit playing tennis, the autos
pointed towards where we were going to
land, and when we threw out the anchor and
came down to the ground and made a landing
right on the golf links near the tennis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>court, we were soon surrounded by twenty
or thirty men, women and children, and Pa
got out and took off his hat and made a bow
that would have captured any people of any
nationality.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa was going to speak to the people in
French or German, but a man in riding
breeches came up and in the purest English
said, “I beg pardon, but is this Mr. Roosevelt?”
and Pa said, “Not on your life, but
just as good a man all right.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The man said he was expecting Mr. Roosevelt
but not until after the 4th of March, but
he didn’t know but what he had come a
little ahead of schedule time. Pa said he
was a Roosevelt man all right, though he’d
always been a Democrat, and that he was
an American.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But what are you doing in Africa?” said
the man who seemed to be the leading citizen.
“O!” said Pa, as he lit a cigarette, “I
have been taking in a large part of Africa,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>and just dropped down to see if you had any
news of the election in the United States.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The man said he was an American too,
and lived in Michigan when at home, but he
came out here for his wife’s health, and
opened up a little ranch. He said Taft was
elected all right, and Pa said he thought it
would come out that way, and then the man
asked us into the house, and the others
crowded around our airship, and before long
the cowboy was riding a polo pony, and I
was playing tennis with some boys about
as big as me, and Pa was drinking highballs
and club soda, and as the rum went down
and we sat around a regular dining table,
eating off of regular dishes, with knives
and forks, and listening to people talk our
language, and laugh right out loud, the first
experience of the kind we had enjoyed in
six months, and we thought how only a few
hours before we were with a tribe of canniballs,
billed to be eaten at sundown, we
thought how small the world was, and joined
in the prayer offered by the host.</p>

about 50 Cigars<a id='tn278a'></a>—Pa Told What Cowards
Lions and Tigers Were—Pa Walked
up to a Lion and Gave Him a Cut with a

<p class='c017'>We have spent a comple of days at the
Michigan man’s ranch in Darkest Africa,
where he has brought civilization right into
the Jungle, and after spending six months
with negro savages and wild animals, and
menagerie people, it has been the most enjoyable
two days I ever knew.</p>

<p class='c018'>It is good sometimes to see ourselves as
others see us, and not having looked into a
mirror for half a year, we found that we
were about the most disreputable looking
tourists that ever came in sight of beds with
linen sheets on, and pillows.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>I noticed that the family of the Michigan
man and the servants looked at us with suspicion,
and turned up their noses at us, but
I never realized what it was all about until
they showed us to our rooms that night,
when I saw myself in a mirror, and found
that my face and hands were black with dirt
and smoke, my clothes were greasy and
patched with buckskin patches, sewed on
with strips of rawhide, and my torn coat
was pinned together with thorns. I could
see Pa and the cowboy all the time, and
knew that they looked like tramps, but I
thought I was all right.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Michigan man showed us to our
rooms, after Pa and the cowboy had drank
a few quarts of highballs, and they were
going to go to bed with their clothes on, but
I knew they would ruin the beds if they did,
so I insisted that we all get in the bath tubs
and take our semi-annual bath, and as the
man left us he said we could find clothes to
put on in the morning, in a closet, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>leave our clothes out in the hall and he
would have a servant take them away with
the tongs and burn them in the furnace.</p>

<p class='c018'>That sobered Pa and the cowboy a little,
and they decided to try the baths.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, we didn’t do a thing to the running
water, and before we retired we had washed
ourselves so clean, with real soap, the first
we had seen since we left Germany, that Pa
and the cowboy had to be introduced to
each other, and I was so clean that I didn’t
know myself, and we put on pajamas that
we found in the room, and crawled into the
clean beds and slept till morning, after putting
all of our clothes out of the room, to
purify the air.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the morning we dressed up in the
clothes the Michigan man told us we would
find in the closet, and such a transformation
was never seen before.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa found a pair of gray pants and a frock
coat, and a silk hat, and when he was dressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>and had on a white shirt he looked like a
senator from South Carolina.</p>

<p class='c018'>The cowboy found a golf suit, with short
pants, long socks, and putty leggins, and a
Tam o’ Shanter cap, and he looked like an
escaped Scotchman, while I found a Buster
Brown suit that fit me, and all I wanted was
a dog to be complete, and we went down to
breakfast, and made a hit, the family acting
as though they were proud to have us in
their midst.</p>

<p class='c018'>During breakfast they all drew Pa out,
and he told them of his experiences capturing
wild animals in Africa, and exploring
the country, and being made king of a
tribe, and they called Pa “Your Highness,”
and Pa lied enough about his adventures to
send him over the road for disorderly conduct.</p>

<p class='c018'>The women drew out the cowboy, and he
lied some on his own account, and the children
got me to going, and you know how it
is with me when I get to going.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>When the breakfast was over we were all
heroes, and Pa pulled out a handful of uncut
diamonds and spread them on the table
by his plate, and gave each one a diamond
as big as a hickory nut, and left a lot of
smaller ones on the table with the bread
crumbs for the servants, and when we left
the table the whole family bowed low to us,
and stood back until the king and the cowboy
and I had passed out on to the veranda.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gee, but they seemed to think King Edward
wouldn’t be ace high to Pa, and Pa
swelled up so I thought he might bust.</p>

<div id='il_35'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/airship_pic35.png'><img src='images/airship_pic35.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Pa Swelled Up So I Thought He Might Bust.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>After smoking some fifty cigars, Pa told
of what cowards lions and tigers were, and
how he could take a riding whip and chase a
lion up a tree, and the Michigan man proposed
to have an exhibit of his wild animals,
which he kept in his private forest outside
of the clearing. He had a race track in the
clearing next to the forest, and told Pa that
every morning his herders turned a lot of
lions, giraffes, rhinoceroses and zebras into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>the track, and the family chased them
around the track in automobiles, and Pa said
he would like to enter into such a race, and
the man ordered the herders to turn in the
animals.</p>

<p class='c018'>The cowboy wanted a saddle horse and a
lariat rope, and they fixed him out, and
when the herders announced that the animals
were on the track all right, we got into
the waiting autos, the man and Pa lit cigars
and sat on the front seat with the chauffeur,
and some of us got in the back seats and
started out.</p>

<p class='c018'>When the animals saw us coming they
started down the home stretch, and the auto
gave chase, and we yelled and fired guns in
the air, and the chauffeur put a charge of
bird shot into the hind hams of a lion that
didn’t seem to be in much of a hurry, and
the lion turned on us, and Pa told the chauffeur
to stop and he would settle with the
lion.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa got out with a horse whip and started
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>for the lion, which gave a roar like distant
thunder, and as I looked at Pa with the frock
coat and silk hat, walking towards the lion
I thought that was the last of Pa, and begged
him to come back, but he said, “Never you
mind me, I have seen lions before,” and Pa
walked up to the lion and gave him a cut
with the whip, and yelled, “Get back into the
jungle, you Tom Cat.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, really, that lion ought to have
turned and put his tail between his legs
and galloped for the woods, but Pa had
made a mistake in his lion, for the animal
went up to Pa and took a mouthful of his
pants, and shook him like a dog would shake
a rat, and Pa yelled for them to take away
their lion if they didn’t want the animal injured.</p>

<p class='c018'>The animal rolled Pa over on the ground
in the dust, chewed his silk hat, and Pa got
loose and made a rush for the auto and
crawled under it to fix something, and just
then the cowboy came along on a pony and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>threw his lariat over the lion’s head and
pulled him away across the track, and Pa
came out from under the machine and took a
big monkey-wrench and started again for
the lion, bareheaded, and so mad he fairly
frothed at the mouth, after he saw the lion
was choked nearly to death, and then Pa
mauled the apparently dead lion until the
cowboy dismounted from the pony and gave
his lariat rope back.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa gave the lion a couple of kicks, and
got back into the auto, and the Michigan
man patted him on the back and said, “Old
man, you are a king of beasts, sure enough;”
and Pa said, “O, I don’t know; I never did
like a cowardly lion, no how.”</p>

<p class='c018'>We chased some more animals around the
track, and the Michigan man said he hoped
the toothless old lion would not die, as he
was saving him for Roosevelt to practice on
when he came to the ranch after the 4th of
March.</p>

<p class='c018'>The cowboy went across the field where a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>tame giraffe was grazing in a tree top, and
took the saddle off his pony and put it on
the giraffe, and we run up to where he was,
and the Michigan man asked him what he
was going to do, and he said he was going
to ride the giraffe, as he had ridden almost
everything that walked on four legs except
a giraffe.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Michigan man told him he had better
leave the giraffe out of his repertoire, because
a giraffe was mighty uncertain, but
the cowboy got the saddle on, and climbed
into it, and then the trouble began.</p>

<p class='c018'>The giraffe didn’t have any bridle on, and
no mane to hold on to, and he was built so
that the saddle slipped down by his rump,
and when the animal turned around and saw
he had the cowboy where he wanted him, he
started off towards the forest on a hop, skip
and a jump, kicking up his heels like a bucking
broncho, and the last we saw of the expedition
the giraffe had jumped over a wire
fence and took to the woods, with the cowboy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>dangling by one stirrup, swearing in the
Wyoming dialect.</p>

<div id='il_36'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/airship_pic36.png'><img src='images/airship_pic36.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Giraffe Didn’t Have Any Bridle On—and No Mane to Hold On To.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Then we went back to the house to play
golf, and the Michigan man sent some servants
into the woods with a strecher to bring
in the remains of the cowboy.</p>

<p class='c018'>As we dismounted at the veranda, Pa lit
a cigarette and said to the man, “You certainly
have all the comforts of a home here,
and all the facilities for enjoyment that anybody
has outside of a traveling menagerie,
except draw poker.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“We can fix you all right on the draw
poker,” said the Michigan man.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Boy, bring the chips and the cards, and
let me know when they find the remains of
Mr. Cowboy,” and they began to play poker,
and I went out to see them milk a Jersey
cow.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>Pa and the Boy Have a Series of Ups and
Downs—Pa Plays Poker with the Michigan
Man and Loses All His Money—Pa
Puts Up His Airship and Loses—Pa and
the Boy Start for Hamburg—The Boy
Makes a King’s Crown Out of Tin—The
Boy Tells How They Escaped from the
Negro Tribes in Africa.</p>

<p class='c017'>It seems to be just one series of ups and
downs with Pa and I. One day we are kings
and things, and the next day we are just
things and not kings, or ninespots, or anything
in the deck, except it’s Jacks.</p>

<p class='c018'>That short stay at the ranch of the Michigan
man in Africa, which seemed like being
set down from hades in Darkest Africa to
Heaven in America, terminated just as
everything else does with us.</p>

<p class='c018'>After we had enjoyed the morning with
the wild animals on the race track, Pa and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>the Michigan man set into a game of draw
poker with some other sharps and the cowboy,
and they must have stacked the cards
on Pa and the cowboy, for before night they
had got all Pa’s money away, and the cowboy
was burst, too, and in the evening Pa
put the airship up against the creamery and
a drove of Jerseys, and Pa lost the airship,
and then Pa gave checks on a bank in the
River Nile, and lost all the checks, and about
a pint of the diamonds, and when we went
to bed the Michigan man said he hated to
part with us, but if we must go he would
send us over to Lake Victoria Nigouza,
where we could take a steamer for Hamburg.</p>

<p class='c018'>We didn’t sleep much that night, and the
next morning the auto was at the door, and
we took what little stuff Pa had not lost
playing poker, and crossed the country to
the lake, at a town where Pa sold some of
his uncut diamonds for money enough to
pay for our passage to Hamburg, and we got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>on board the vessel and got into our state
rooms.</p>

<p class='c018'>Just before we were ready to start an officer
came on board looking for two white
men who had been giving checks that were
no good, and for selling diamonds that would
not wash.</p>

<p class='c018'>I heard about it, and there was such a
crowd that the vesselmen did not remember
Pa and the cowboy, but they said the officers
could search the vessel if they
wanted to.</p>

<p class='c018'>I went to the state room and told Pa and
he turned pale, and trembled like a leaf, and
the brave cowboy had a fit. They were
scared at the prospect of being taken ashore
and put in an English jail, and Pa sweat so
he looked like a hippopotamus sweating
blood.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pa said they were up a stump, and asked
me if I could think of anything to help them
out. I told Pa the only thing for us to do
was to take a burned cork and black up, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>pretend that Pa was an African king, on the
way to England to have a conference with
King Edward about tribal affairs.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gee, but Pa and the cowboy bit like a bass
and I got a champagne cork and burned
it over the lamp and went to work bleaching
us all up, and in half an hour we were three
of the blackest niggers that ever emigrated
from Africa. I even blacked the place on
Pa’s leg where the lion had chewed a hole
through his pants.</p>

<p class='c018'>We looked at ourselves in the mirror, and
inspected each other, and couldn’t find a
white spot, and then I told Pa what to do
when the officers of the law came.</p>

<p class='c018'>He was to be seated in state, on a high
chair, looking like a nigger king, and the
cowboy and I were to get down on our knees
before him and kowtow.</p>

<p class='c018'>I got a crown made out of a tin basin, and
a feather duster for a plume, and fixed Pa
up so that any tribe would have gone wild
over him.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Just as we got Pa fixed up, and we had
all stopped laughing, there was a knock at
the door of the state room, and I opened it,
and two semi-Englishmen came in looking
for Pa and the cowboy, but when I waved
my hand and said, “Behold the King of
Natabeland,” and the cowboy bit the duster
and saluted Pa, and Pa looked savage and
said in broken negro, “What, ho! varlets,”
the officers said, “Beg pardon, don’t you
know, your ’ighness,” and they backed out
of the door, making salaams, and soon disappeared.
Gee, it was a close call.</p>

<p class='c018'>Soon after the engine began to turn the
screw of the propeller, and when we looked
out of the porthole the vessel was going towards
the ocean, and when I told Pa he got
down off his throne and danced a jig and
hugged the cowboy, and we were having a
jollification when there was another rap at
the door, and Pa jumped up on the throne
and put on his tin basin crown, and I opened
the door, and the steward of the vessel came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>in with his hat in his hands, and asked Pa
what he would have for supper. Pa said he
didn’t care what he had if he only got it
quick, and the steward said mostly when
they were carrying African kings to England
they served the meals in the state
rooms, as the kings did not care to sit at
the same table with the common herd, and
Pa said that suited him all right, and the
steward added that the passengers also complained
of the manners of the African kings,
and the smell that they emitted in the cabin.</p>

<div id='il_37'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/airship_pic37.png'><img src='images/airship_pic37.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>There Was a Knock at the Door of the Stateroom.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Pa was going to get hot at that remark,
but I was afraid the burnt cork would rub
off, so I said His Highness would be served
in his state room, and to bring the best the
ship offered, and bring it quick if he didn’t
want trouble aboard, and he bowed low and
went out, and pretty soon the waiters began
to bring in oysters and soup and turkey and
boiled pheasants, and ice cream, and we
kings and things didn’t do a thing to the
food, and when the dishes were taken away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>empty, and the wine had been drank, and
the cigars brought in, King Pa got down
from his throne and just yelled, and he said
to the cowboy, “Say, Alkali Ike, wouldn’t
this skin you?” and Ike said he guessed it
would when they found out what frauds we
were, and after awhile we turned in and
slept just like we were at home.</p>

<p class='c018'>For several days they fed us like they were
fattening us for a sausage factory, and the
ocean was blue and calm, and we were let
out on deck near our state room for exercise,
and I kept burning cork and keeping us all
blacked up nice, and Pa would repeat African
words that he had picked up, mixed
with English words, and everybody kept
their distance and thought we were the real
nigger thing.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, everything was going along beautifully,
and we thought we had never struck
such a snap in all our lives, until about the
fifth day.</p>

<p class='c018'>We had eaten so much that our appetites
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>had gone, and Pa and the cowboy took to
drinking more and more, and one night it
began to blow, and the vessel was part of
the time on one end and then on the other,
and then rolling from side to side, so that
Pa couldn’t sit on his throne without sideboards,
and towards morning we all got seasick
and fell all over the state room, and Pa
had a pain under his belt that doubled him
up like a jackknife, and he yelled for a doctor.
I told him never to send for a doctor
until the boat tied up at a dock, because it
was dangerous, but Pa said he had to have a
doctor, and the cowboy had drank a bottle
of Scotch whiskey and had laid down under
a bunk, and he was no good, so I rang for
the ship’s doctor, but I told Pa he must
keep the parts of his body that were not
black covered up, or the doctor would find
out he was a white man, and then it would
be all off in the nigger king masquerade.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pretty soon the ship’s doctor came with a
female trained nurse, and Pa was a pitiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>sight when he saw them. The doctor felt of
Pa’s pulse, and asked him where the pain
was, and Pa, like a darn fool, put his hand
on his stomach, and before Pa could stop it
the doctor had opened Pa’s shirt, and was
feeling where the appendix gets in its work.</p>

<div id='il_38'  class='figcenter id002'>
<a href='images/airship_pic38.png'><img src='images/airship_pic38.png' alt='' class='ig001'></a>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Pretty Soon the Ship’s Doctor Came with a Nurse.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>It was a little dark, but the doctor said,
“You old seney ambion, you have got about
the worst case of appendicitis that was ever
pulled off on this vessel. Boy, bring me that
lantern.”</p>

<p class='c018'>I hated to do it, because I knew Pa would
be discovered, and I delayed bringing the
lantern as long as I could, but, turning the
wick down, but the doctor snatched a match
so he could see Pa’s stomach, and then he
said, “Say, old skate, you are no more nigger
king than I am; you are a white man
blacked up;” and the trained nurse said,
“The ’ell you say,” and then I got the
lantern and they looked at Pa’s white
skin, and the doctor asked Pa what he
had to say for himself, and Pa admitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>that he was a white man, but said he
had many of the estimable qualities of
a nigger, but that he was traveling incog,
to throw his enemies off the track,
and then Pa fainted away from the pain, and
the cowboy got sober enough to wake up
and take notice, and we told the doctor who
we were, and how we had escaped from
negro tribes and draw poker sharps and officers
of the law, and the cowboy fell in love
at first sight with the trained nurse, and then
Pa came to, with the aid of a bucket of water
and some whiskey, and the storm went
down, and the doctor said Pa would have to
have an operation performed to remove his
appendix, and Pa kicked about it, but they
took him to the ship’s hospital, with the
cowboy for an assistant nurse, and I was
left alone in our state room, the only king
there was left, and when I washed off my
burnt cork I was so white and pale that they
gave me medicine, and the trained nurse
held me on her lap and sang English songs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>to me, with all the h’s left out, and every
day she told me how they removed Pa’s appendix,
and it was swollen up bigger than
a weiner sausage, but that he would live all
right, and when he got well enough the captain
would put Pa in irons for passing himself
off for a nigger king, and that he would
probably be transported for life, if he
couldn’t raise the price of a ransom. And
there you are.</p>
